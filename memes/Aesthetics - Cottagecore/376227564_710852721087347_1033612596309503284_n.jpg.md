<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme shows a before-and-after comparison of a forest in the Netherlands. The top image shows a barren, dry field in 2009, while the bottom image shows a lush, green forest in 2022. The text at the bottom of the image reads: &quot;The Ketelbroek food forest is located in Groesbeek, Netherlands. The food forest was started in 2009 by Wouter van Eck and Pieter Jansen and now contains 32 food-producing species of plants on its 2.5 hectares (6 acres) of land.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">te, A ol Sa a ; : ss , ras ao oe wo . =e . . = Sag Se ag ss sa ing BS a erg: aa 2 Se ee pt th ng oe eee See , ey % 7 ar , See i a ae —— 2009 : ove BE - oo in i ns re ee I A 3 a i angen ee cna Ge ‘ ok We ®Wouter Van Eck The Ketelbroek food forest is located in Groesbeek, Netherlands.
