<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous commentary on the way of life of our ancestors. The text reads: &quot;They called our way of life primitive, then created a way of life that destroys the earth in less than 200 years.&quot; The image is likely a simple, dark background with a small, circular icon of a person, possibly a cartoon or a real person&#x27;s photo, but the text is the main focus.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Bigeaiee ditt ia ee gesmestet ed ene oe BL erm Sf Two LeEcIon - ae a @StreamMajor9 i They called our way of life primitive then created a way of life that destroyes the earth in less than 200 years.</p>
