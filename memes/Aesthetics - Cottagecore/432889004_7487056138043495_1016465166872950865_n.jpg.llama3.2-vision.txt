This meme is a humorous take on the concept of a meeting where everyone is too focused on their own work to engage with others.

The idea is that instead of a meeting, it could have been a chance for the mycelium networks to exchange nutrients, which is a clever and humorous way to poke fun at the idea of a meeting.
