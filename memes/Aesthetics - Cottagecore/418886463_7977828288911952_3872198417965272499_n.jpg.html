<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous commentary on the concept of &quot;foodscaping&quot; or &quot;foodscaping&quot; (a mix-up of &quot;food&quot; and &quot;landscaping&quot;), where each yard has a vegetable garden with fruit trees. The image is an aerial view of a densely populated neighborhood, with each yard filled with lush greenery and trees, creating a beautiful and vibrant landscape. The text at the top of the image reads: &quot;This is called &#x27;Foodscaping&#x27;. Each yard has a vegetable garden with fruit trees. Neighbors consult with each other so they can trade the food that is grown. Imagine if people did this everywhere.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
<p>This is called “Foodscaping”. Each yard has a vegetable garden with fruit trees. Neighbors consult with each other so they can trade the food that is grown. Imagine if people did this everywhere.  x 7 ry x _ 4 ‘ ‘ 4 2  . \ hal AS ms » . c =</p>
