<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is an image of a dark, ornate, and luxurious-looking room, possibly a library or study, with a large window and a high ceiling. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just on energy-saving mode&quot; is written in a small, curved font at the top of the image. The image is likely intended to be humorous, implying that the person is not actually doing nothing, but rather conserving energy to be more productive later.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
