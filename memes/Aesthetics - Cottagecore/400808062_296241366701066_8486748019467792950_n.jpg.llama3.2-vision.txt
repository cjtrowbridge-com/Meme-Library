This meme is a play on the differences between two types of fungi: Mycorrhizae and Ourcorhizae. The text "Mycorrhizae" is written above a drawing of a mushroom's roots, while "Ourcorhizae" is written above a drawing of a mushroom's roots with a hammer and sickle symbol (the symbol of the Soviet Union) incorporated into the roots. The joke is that Mycorrhizae is a type of fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with plants, while Ourcorhizae is a made-up word that sounds similar but is actually a reference to the Soviet Union.
