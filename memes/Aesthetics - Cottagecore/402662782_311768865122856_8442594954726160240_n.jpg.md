<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is an image of a small, modern, and minimalist house with a single room and a large deck. The text &quot;Tiny House, Big Ego&quot; appears above the house, suggesting that the house&#x27;s owner is trying to make up for its small size by being overly proud and self-important. The image is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, poking fun at the idea of someone trying to make a big deal out of a tiny house.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Ree MNO cn he eS SY lege ces A RAE ie a ss ai a Sea at &quot;2 een SR ad Ae Me a ae felis eo i Oe 7 ORRIN Sas Lace ON RN ices cae Lene nee eee een eeee Rea ipesee ee a as Pee si Ce ee ee aa S Le ae Be rt Aa can Page ad P SS AN ie | er a | a Boe eam? \ UST me Z ass ee SSS ee oe SSS ag = Se? ! ot ey yl Ul: on) i &amp; bo - 4 ae a!
