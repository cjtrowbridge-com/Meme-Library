<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a photo of a small, unfinished wooden cabin in the woods, with a sign on the door that says &quot;Abandon all hope, you will not be saved&quot;. The image is likely a humorous take on the idea of a &quot; cabin in the woods&quot; being a place of refuge, but instead of a cozy and peaceful atmosphere, it&#x27;s a place of despair and hopelessness.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">¥ : 7 oe 7% a (i es : ‘ eye ee : 4 ee. ae ‘ i &#125; a - . . 4 = , AOS&#125; b - i oN &gt; ae Re % he: . sige: : ee ee  aes * MS . ks  eG sh tere &gt; eee +, oe Mes Sy v CA ea if Pe Ce ri eae Peery 4333 a , 4° &#x27; % vt . a he rae eet F mek i ie te eae t i y ; - ev&#125; ee) a . = -* id Dy ea ® i LX &amp; ~ ar oy yer 4 y M: ® as = :  nS wy 7 “e Ti 9? | Yi .  f cag Fr * | if eA ( Nl :  , j x F F ; : ey Ia 4 \ | i’ | U ‘So if , v/, 4 qT Poh TNC NEENT Th ei wey.” a8 eS — i “4 V &quot; - ; a — e 2 6 =a eats “ a P ON Raa. © \ Se. ee és ae . ~*~ oto = % —— &gt; er a Oe oF &#x27; &gt; a oe  a ¢ aw —— Zs  Sous — Fe Ge : pers - Sb en, s ta &amp; 2 5 = = ge  Bn oe ae _— oN Ste res ee ie ess 4 ee Sane</p>
