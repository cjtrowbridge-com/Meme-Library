<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous take on a person&#x27;s lack of social planning. The text at the top reads &quot;Me: Sorry, I can&#x27;t hang out later, I have plans&quot; and the response is &quot;Me, later&quot;. The image below is a drawing of a person standing in front of a tree, with the tree&#x27;s roots and branches wrapping around them, implying they&#x27;re being &quot;blended&quot; into the tree. The caption &quot;Figure 2-32: Allow the Tree&#x27;s Aura to Blend with Your Own&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a supposed &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;new age&quot; practice.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
