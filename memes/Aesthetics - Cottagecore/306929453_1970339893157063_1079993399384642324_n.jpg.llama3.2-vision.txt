This meme is a humorous take on the common phrase "I have to work today when I'd rather be doing something else." The image is a fantastical, cartoon-like map of a world that includes a variety of environments, such as mountains, forests, and oceans. The text at the top reads, "Tragic that I have to work today when all I want to do is be in one of these places."
