<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme features a cartoon cat with a sassy expression, accompanied by the phrase &quot;what a f***ed up time to be alive&quot; in a playful, cursive font. The cat&#x27;s eyes are depicted with a &quot;wink&quot; emoticon, adding to its mischievous tone. The overall image conveys a sense of irony and humor, poking fun at the absurdity of modern life.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
