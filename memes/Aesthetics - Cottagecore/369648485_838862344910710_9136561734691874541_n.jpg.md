<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a play on the phrase &quot;the goal is to get the bag,&quot; a popular saying that means achieving success or wealth. The image shows a large house and garden, with the caption &quot;the goal is to get the bag&quot; above it, and the response &quot;but the goal is to get the land&quot; below it. The meme is poking fun at the idea that people often focus on material wealth, but the real goal is to have a stable and secure life, like owning a house and land, rather than just wealth.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">tea : - F Bees se &amp; : it) Sia ath: , Pra . ‘ Mise mee 5 i faa ee 3 A alse vale fa 4 ug ae p Ss tt ge — ay f/f YS iN ni] | o ® aN | a aa &#x27; ai : ak im mn Bes SS es 5 ml | ma EL ey l in Zoo a ee PES SOD EE ho aig ere ea aie sane a ce Bae iS ee ee ee ee alta : Psi ED coo Praga = cama g&#x27;s ae aa .s gages ety f GOP i ie Ee, eee ae aE ee eee ap ae W Po Pe a ae a gues emg vy Z ; é ee al a, a RO ae ae Bee</p>
