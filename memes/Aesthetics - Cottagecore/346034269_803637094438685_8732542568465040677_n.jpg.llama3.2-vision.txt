This meme is a comparison of two aerial images of a farm, one taken in 2010 and the other in 2022. The top image shows a small, empty farm with a few buildings, while the bottom image shows a much larger and more developed farm with many more buildings and a large number of cars. The text above the images reads "Limestone Farm - May 2010" and "Limestone Farm - May 2022".
