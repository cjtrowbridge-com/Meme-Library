This meme is a humorous image of a person building a small cabin using a single sheet of paper, titled "The Squatter". The text reads: "Built in one day by two men. Heats quickly. No under-draughts. Sheet iron stove may be substituted for fireplace. With heavy snow it will keep warm in sub-zero weather. Use 2 x 4 timbers throughout. Use this cabin before you build your prize cabin." The image is likely meant to be humorous and satirical, poking fun at the idea of building a simple, simple cabin.
