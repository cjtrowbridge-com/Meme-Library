<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a play on the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero&#x27;s quote, &quot;If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.&quot; The meme takes this phrase and applies it to a modern-day situation, implying that if you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">FE vf, Gp Sy &quot;If you have a ee Aw garden and a res iS.
