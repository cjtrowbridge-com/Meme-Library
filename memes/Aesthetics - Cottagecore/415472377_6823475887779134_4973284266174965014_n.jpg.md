<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a humorous image of a garden with a chicken coop in the background. The text &quot;Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can&quot; is written in a playful, modern font, with the words &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, and &quot;Do&quot; in bold. The image is meant to be a humorous and relatable take on the classic phrase &quot;start where you are, use what you have, do what you can&quot;, with the addition of a garden and a chicken coop in the background, implying that one can start a garden or a chicken farm with what they have.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Pe eae &lt; Per RC Se 2 er a Start WHERE YOU ARE ee UF AV) Gy Cole Ey WY) =2 ee Se oR Win Wen Zol0) (or \\)  we | ‘el E mi er ee a 5 Bel Fe eRe ES, eae STE eee» aaa  Be cc ps ie in 4 uh | TN ee ly |e  A fe Ng oF ai SR | py = We 5 5 oa. | -S Rae Oe ee AS Bras cas A a rt S| alr 2 EF) Vg Re i ee sas on a F ) ae) 7, ee ee Ce Seer) = ane SN a 77/0 Mn NM eee ee eat enc ree wig Ye ei ee ee Yipes.
