<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the idea that some people&#x27;s jobs or careers are not as exciting or fulfilling as they would like. The text &quot;Not interested in a &#x27;career&#x27; just looking for the least annoying way to pay the bills&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek expression of this sentiment. The image is likely a humorous or relatable image, but the text itself is the focus of the meme.</p>
