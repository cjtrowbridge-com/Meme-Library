The meme is a humorous take on a person's lack of social planning. The text at the top reads "Me: Sorry, I can't hang out later, I have plans" and the response is "Me, later". The image below is a drawing of a person standing in front of a tree, with the tree's roots and branches wrapping around them, implying they're being "blended" into the tree. The caption "Figure 2-32: Allow the Tree's Aura to Blend with Your Own" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a supposed "spiritual" or "new age" practice.
