The meme is a humorous comparison between a lawn that has been left unattended for three years and a lush, overgrown garden. The top image shows a barren, weed-covered lawn with a few bare trees, while the bottom image shows a vibrant, flowering garden with a variety of plants and trees. The text at the top reads "Results from a No Lawn experiment after 3 years" and the bottom image has the year "2023" written on it.
