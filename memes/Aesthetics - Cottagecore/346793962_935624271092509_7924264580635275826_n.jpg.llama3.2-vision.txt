The meme is a humorous comparison between two movie titles. The top image is a mining scene, with the text "In Search of Gold" above it. The bottom image is a scene of people walking through a green field, with the text "We lost the diamond" above it. The meme is poking fun at the idea that the second title is a more accurate description of what happened in the first movie.
