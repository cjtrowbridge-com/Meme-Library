<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a visual representation of a city&#x27;s infrastructure being completely overgrown by nature. The image shows a city&#x27;s roads, buildings, and infrastructure being covered in lush greenery, with trees and vines crawling over everything. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not saying we&#x27;re not doing anything, I&#x27;m just saying we&#x27;re doing it differently&quot; appears in the image, implying that the city is being taken over by nature in a way that is not being actively controlled.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">OO NR SRS as S RL Re EOE E eR cus TS Skee hele BE MSE Ghee eee ct ot er ER AS ra me ee ee ae SS i Ste ey E¥icicouet se gt ws salen eee alee &lt;e ee oy Gna es eee GN Ri ee. ’ Fe ie Aigrniay Sere pers ce Sa eee ‘4 ee re RS ; spn ea ome = SA ee . ‘ prathit. ae eee &lt;r Re | CaaS p pe NSS ea ale i ae see Vd a 8 PS Pe 2 02S no aia Oe Se A % F ety BP ess ve Sa = ee a ‘ 7 3 eee Sie Ba iG Je ee ore ae.
