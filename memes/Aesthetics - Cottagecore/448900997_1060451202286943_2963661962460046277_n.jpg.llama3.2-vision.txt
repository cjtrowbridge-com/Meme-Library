This meme is a humorous take on the stereotype that anarcho-activists are often associated with environmentalism and living in harmony with nature. The image features a quote that says "yes i am an extremely radical anarchist" followed by "quietly waters plants", implying that the speaker's radicalism is not as extreme as they think, and they're actually just a gentle gardener. The meme pokes fun at the idea that anarcho-activists are not as radical as they claim to be, and instead are just ordinary people who enjoy gardening.
