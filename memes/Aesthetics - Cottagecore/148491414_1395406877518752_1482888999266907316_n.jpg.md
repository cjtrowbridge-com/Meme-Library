<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous commentary on the concept of &quot;cottagecore,&quot; a popular online aesthetic that celebrates a romanticized, rural, and often fantastical view of life. The text &quot;is cottagecore actually your aesthetic&quot; is presented in a playful, cursive font, while the response &quot;or do you just yearn for the means to provide for yourself and your community away from the soul-crushing grip of capitalism?&quot; is written in a more serious, block-like font. The image itself is not described, as it is not possible to provide a description of something that cannot be seen.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">4 i y ie is&#125;cottagecore actually Va aesthetic ay) 7a a Le SE eS ‘ es. fi ae EDR ae ; VUE ir at REA APO) on&#125; | SO OOO eM OTT , OOK Sah 4 al od i ys m0 | | j &quot;4 Pe OOO ae : va sy OK OX, i Se 7 A eine, a ae cada. 5 \y we = Yo geet wa ieee oe | ao ae, 7 oe eS / HB Ff ih a 2 : fondo you: just amar CUpULaE [as SOPYVODEAYSL som le I tae =&quot; digeattl CREA MASS ines Pre ¥ ae 3 : ‘ - , ae So , &lt; an. me. a e ss i ae Me lip uae . eee Oh.
