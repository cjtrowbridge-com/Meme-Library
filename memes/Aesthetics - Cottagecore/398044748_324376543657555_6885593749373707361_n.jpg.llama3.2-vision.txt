The meme is a humorous comparison between two types of lawns: one made of artificial turf and one made of living plants. The text "THIS KILLS LIFE" appears above a photo of a lawn made of artificial turf, while "THIS CREATES LIFE" appears above a photo of a garden or garden-like setting. The meme is saying that while a lawn made of artificial turf is lifeless and life-destroying, a garden or garden-like setting is full of life and life-creating.
