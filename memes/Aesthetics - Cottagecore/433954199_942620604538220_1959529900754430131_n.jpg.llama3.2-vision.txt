The meme is a drawing of a small, self-sustaining village, with various buildings and gardens, including a wind turbine, a solar panel, and a composting toilet. The text "Permaculture" appears at the top, and the image is surrounded by a caption that says "I'm not lazy, I'm just...". The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, suggesting that the person is not actually living off the land, but rather has just been very careful to plan and prepare for their own self-sufficiency.
