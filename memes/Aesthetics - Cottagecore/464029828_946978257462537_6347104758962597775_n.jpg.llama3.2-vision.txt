This meme features a wizard in a forest, looking at a clock that says "hast" (an old-fashioned word for "has") and "not" (a negative word). The text above the image reads "No, I will not be late" and the text below it says "No, I will not be on time". The image is humorous because it shows a wizard who is both late and on time, which is a contradictory and absurd situation.
