<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous commentary on the concept of &quot;accessible housing.&quot; It features an image of a small, cozy house in a forest, with the phrase &quot;Accessible housing is a human right&quot; superimposed over it in bold, yellow letters. The text is meant to be ironic, implying that the idea of accessible housing is not only a basic human right, but also a simple and obvious one.</p>
