This meme is a joke about a news article about abandoned golf courses being reclaimed by nature. The text "Abandoned golf courses are being reclaimed by nature" is shown above a picture of a golf course. Below the text is a comic strip of a man who says "Yes... ha ha ha... yes!" as he watches a golf course being reclaimed by nature, but his name "Sickos" is written on a sign in the background, implying he's the one responsible for the golf course being abandoned.
