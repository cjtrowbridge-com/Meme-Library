This meme is a humorous commentary on the state of human existence. The text reads: "humans really could have had a beautiful little existence on earth just creating art and eating fruit. instead we have credit scores and taxes." The meme pokes fun at the idea that humans have become so focused on material wealth and financial success that we have lost the simple, simple pleasures of life.
