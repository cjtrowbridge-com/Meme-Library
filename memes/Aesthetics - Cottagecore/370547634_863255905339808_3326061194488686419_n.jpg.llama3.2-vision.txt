The meme is a screenshot of a tweet from the Twitter account "Comrade California, Empress of Antarctica" (a parody of the Disney character). The tweet reads: "The Dust Bowl was a dress rehearsal for what's coming." The text is presented in a simple, white font on a black background, with the Twitter account's name and the date and time of the tweet ("1:07 PM Â· 2021-08-20") displayed below. The tweet is a darkly humorous comment on the state of the world, implying that the devastating events of the 1930s (the Dust Bowl) were a precursor to the more catastrophic events that are currently happening.
