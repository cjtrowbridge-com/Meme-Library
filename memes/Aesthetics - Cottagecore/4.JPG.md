<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is an image of a futuristic, towering skyscraper made entirely of books, with a massive, glowing &quot;I&quot; in the center of the building. The image is accompanied by the text &quot;I&quot; and the caption &quot;I&quot;. The meme is likely a humorous commentary on the idea that a single, self-identifying &quot;I&quot; can be the entire foundation of a massive, complex structure.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">&gt; a . ” ks fe al P ja a a . pe sn mw F = + a ae ry » Cee, £ x &amp; ell sil oh =e mi ea _ a r gs lla. ‘ a iy a i: ae a ae a gi See tli alii oo a Re lll ae Pus eee ee ead Gas oa | ) an oa “ sg! ae ee ares ‘ee oS ; ; hoe : ae = : EY (ue Se “ee See</p>
