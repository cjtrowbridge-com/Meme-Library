The meme is a photo of a person covered in leaves and vines, with a serious expression. The image is captioned "Dress for the job you want" in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the idea that one should dress professionally for a job interview. The humor comes from the absurdity of dressing in a way that is literally "for the job" of being a tree or a plant.
