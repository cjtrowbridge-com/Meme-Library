<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a young girl from the classic children&#x27;s book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; standing in a forest, facing a large, dark, and ominous-looking creature with glowing eyes. The creature is actually the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; from the book, a monster that has been brought to life by the girl&#x27;s imagination. The text above the girl reads &quot;Are we like this because we drank from the hose?&quot;</p>
