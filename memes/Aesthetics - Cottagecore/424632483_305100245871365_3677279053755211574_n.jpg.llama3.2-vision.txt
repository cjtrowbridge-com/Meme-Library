The meme is a picture of a woman on a rooftop, surrounded by a large collection of potted plants. The text "I can hear you but I don't care" is written above her, implying that she's ignoring the people below her, who are likely complaining about the noise and mess of her plant collection. The humor comes from the contrast between her peaceful, self-sufficient lifestyle and the potential chaos she's causing for her neighbors.
