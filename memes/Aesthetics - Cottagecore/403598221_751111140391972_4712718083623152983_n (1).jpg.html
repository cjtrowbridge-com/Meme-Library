<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the importance of making changes to improve the world. The image shows a lush, green garden, but the text &quot;The greatest change we need to make is from consumption to production&quot; is overlaid, suggesting that the garden is actually a symbol of the need for people to transition from being consumers to being producers, creating their own food and resources. The text is a call to action, urging people to make this change in order to improve the world.</p>
