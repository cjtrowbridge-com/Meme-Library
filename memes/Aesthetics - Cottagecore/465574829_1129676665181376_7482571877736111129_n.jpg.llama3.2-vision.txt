This meme is a humorous comparison between two images of a small, white house. The top image is a plain, unadorned house, while the bottom image is a house transformed into a vibrant, musical-themed wonderland, with a piano-shaped entrance, a "D"J" sign, and a "R"eady" sign. The text "A simple reminder. Life is what you make of it." is written below the bottom image, implying that the second house is a creative, optimistic response to the first one.
