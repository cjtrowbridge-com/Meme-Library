<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a split-screen image showing two different environments. On the left, a cozy cabin with a fireplace and a comfortable chair, with a sign that reads &quot;Welcome to the Cabin&quot;. On the right, a cramped and dirty shipping container with a sign that reads &quot;Welcome to the Shipping Container&quot;. The text at the top of the image reads &quot;When you&#x27;re trying to be cozy but your roommate is a shipping container&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
