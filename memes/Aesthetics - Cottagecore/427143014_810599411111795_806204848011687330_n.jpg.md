<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a black cat perched on a fence, looking out at a small, old-fashioned cottage in the woods. The text above the image reads, &quot;You attract what you fear, a quiet life in a little fairy cottage in the woods, so scary!&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">&quot;u attract what u fear&quot; ahhh a quiet life in alil fairy cottage in a forest !! so scary Tera ina eee ; Be ae eg Pasi. oF eee &#x27; ne yen, tk Sie Ne 7 NS ys ie 3 NOT pata since fede &lt;a ee ee &quot; iia s~o : Ly ‘ (rn i eggs ee Pe Md Be oer a pa t \ . a ”% Ke as ‘S co ORR 3 asa.</p>
