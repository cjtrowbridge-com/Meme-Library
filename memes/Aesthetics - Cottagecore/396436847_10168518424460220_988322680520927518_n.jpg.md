<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a joke about a news article about abandoned golf courses being reclaimed by nature. The text &quot;Abandoned golf courses are being reclaimed by nature&quot; is shown above a picture of a golf course. Below the text is a comic strip of a man who says &quot;Yes... ha ha ha... yes!&quot; as he watches a golf course being reclaimed by nature, but his name &quot;Sickos&quot; is written on a sign in the background, implying he&#x27;s the one responsible for the golf course being abandoned.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">i : .
