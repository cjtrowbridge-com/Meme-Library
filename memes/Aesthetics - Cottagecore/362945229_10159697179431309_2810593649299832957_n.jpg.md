<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image featuring comedian and actor Brian Johnson, known for his &quot;I&#x27;m not a [insert job] I&#x27;m a [insert job]!&quot; catchphrase. The image shows Johnson with a serious expression, and the text &quot;I&#x27;m not a doctor, I&#x27;m a doctor&quot; is written below. The meme is a play on the idea that someone&#x27;s job title is not what they&#x27;re actually doing, but rather what they&#x27;re not.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">; é hy ea  — x - oe m *y i“ a ‘ SN i i, oe - A Se ; “Some poor, phoneless fool is probably sitting next to a waterfall somewhere totally unaware of how angry and scared he&#x27;s supposed to be.” - Duncan Trusell</p>
