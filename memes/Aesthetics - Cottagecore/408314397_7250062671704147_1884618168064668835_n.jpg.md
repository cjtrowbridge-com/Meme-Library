<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the common phrase &quot;I&#x27;m not a food, I&#x27;m a person.&quot; The text reads: &quot;I am not a snack. I am a garden. Take care of me and I can feed you forever.&quot; The meme pokes fun at the idea that people often treat others like they&#x27;re a snack or a meal, rather than a person with needs and feelings.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">|am not a snack.| ama garden. Take care of me and | can feed you forever.</p>
