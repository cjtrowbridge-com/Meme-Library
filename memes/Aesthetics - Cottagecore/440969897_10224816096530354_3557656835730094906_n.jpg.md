<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a sign that reads &quot;This is the awning of the cage of asparagus&quot;. The sign is likely attached to a garden or a greenhouse, and the phrase is a play on words, implying that the asparagus is being protected from the sun or other environmental factors, but is actually a joke about the absurdity of a &quot;cage&quot; for a vegetable.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">G9G6 9 VO a is a ps A LCLEO &quot;)escermcaseaztieh GP aa  4 ¢en Sy (pea Pia ee, ate age eh 3 oe ys Oe y ec) VI Mae  T ly. 7 4a ee : - —a ~ ; rom E 4 a rn ay \&quot;  co oa K Hs IN AE AWA IG &#125; ine meiiiai ey 2 he GAGE”: C0 Bo Fu AT oe fc Y: 4 &#x27; - - &quot; e a&gt;) le \ 3 OF) Astiinave) sf  pees \| LE SEER, 8 Se mar) =&#125;: Se PR ie NA ene , 4 aa a a b fg eros! * “a ai, a “ i 4 . © pad a : A ove cars pee AS : oe aa 4  ay yi&quot; 5 Pe beat a sort. 44 ~ j Pas be &#x27; ‘ r T Wad i t ; as he le ev * r 1p &quot; ea a  = &quot; teas |), Cate mee s SS , &quot;f  eee arth ll aaa cen Aer | SN Adar Ng CRN ak ot aaa 2 aT eink! ain aR Ses re Be eS ae “Pr; cf a args re BS / eM.
