<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a photo of a person holding up a dirty, old, and broken Wii Sports Resort game disc, with a small amount of dirt and plants growing out of it. The text on the disc reads &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot; and has a few scratches and marks on it. The meme is likely poking fun at the idea that even the most high-tech and advanced technology can eventually fall apart and become a part of the natural world.</p>
