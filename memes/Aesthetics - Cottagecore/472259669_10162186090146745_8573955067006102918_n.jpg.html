<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous image of a Canadian homeowner who has taken a drastic approach to keeping their property secure. The image shows a house with a sign that reads &quot;I have a 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence&quot; with a red &quot;X&quot; through each one, implying the homeowner has replaced each of their fences with a sign saying &quot;I have a 10 foot fence&quot;. The text above the image reads &quot;Canadian homeowner built a path instead of a fence when he noticed locals cutting through his property&quot;.</p>
