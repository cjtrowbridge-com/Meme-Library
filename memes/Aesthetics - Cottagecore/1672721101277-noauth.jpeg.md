<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The image is a futuristic cityscape with towering skyscrapers and a lush, green forest in the center. The text &quot;I can see my house from here&quot; is written in a small, humorous font at the top of the image. The city is surrounded by a circular, futuristic-looking road with multiple lanes and a central park.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Wii ert ih » eels “=f I. 4st . +, &lt;= . — # ; iY A, Pe: re iu Wore”), i Ws Ye Ts, ba \ Ms. ANY Fe</p>
