This meme is a humorous take on the concept of "personal gain" versus "community effort." The image features two panels of the character Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation, but with his face replaced with a "meme face" expression. The first panel shows him looking confused, while the second panel shows him looking triumphant. The text in the first panel reads "Glorifying Individual Achievement & Personal Gain," while the second panel reads "Celebrating Community & Collective Effort." The meme is poking fun at the idea that people often prioritize individual success over collective success, and the image is meant to be humorous and relatable.
