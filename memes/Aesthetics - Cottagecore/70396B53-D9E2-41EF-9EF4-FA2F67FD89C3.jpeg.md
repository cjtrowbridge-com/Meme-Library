<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a man in a 19th-century-style painting, specifically &quot;The Angelus&quot; by Jean-François Millet. The image shows a man standing in a field, holding a pitchfork, with a look of intense frustration. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just on [insert time]!&quot; is written above the man&#x27;s head, implying that he&#x27;s not actually working, but rather taking a break.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">lL ae |  z g ‘= ero eey i eae Pe ee</p>
