<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a photo of a wall with shelves that have been converted into a storage space for canned goods. The shelves are filled to the brim with cans of food, with some even spilling over onto the floor. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not hoarding, I&#x27;m just stockpiling&quot; appears at the top of the image.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">a mr oT | ‘ a rt eb ry Pe | ttre ee a Te : x ato . eee = si | H fe Lae ret ce © cre ors EH ae | &lt;a CPEs .
