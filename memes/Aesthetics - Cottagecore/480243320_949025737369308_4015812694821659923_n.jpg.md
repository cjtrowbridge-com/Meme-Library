<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme features a cartoon frog wearing a hat and holding a basket, with a speech bubble saying &quot;Compost the Oligarchy&quot;. The image is a humorous take on the idea of revolutionizing the way we think about food and the power structures that control it. The frog is using a tool to turn over the soil, symbolizing the need to transform the way we approach food and the power structures that control it.</p>
