This meme is a humorous image featuring comedian and actor Brian Johnson, known for his "I'm not a [insert job] I'm a [insert job]!" catchphrase. The image shows Johnson with a serious expression, and the text "I'm not a doctor, I'm a doctor" is written below. The meme is a play on the idea that someone's job title is not what they're actually doing, but rather what they're not.
