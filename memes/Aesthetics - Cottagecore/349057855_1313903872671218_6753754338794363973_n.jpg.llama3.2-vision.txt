This meme is a humorous commentary on the societal expectation of needing a job. It features an image of three women on a beach, but instead of being in a beach setting, they are actually in a painting of a beach, and they're all nude. The text at the top of the image reads, "Why do humans need jobs, why can't I just sit on a beach with my tits out and stare into the ocean until I die?" The image is a satirical take on the idea that people are forced to work for a living, and it's meant to be humorous and relatable.
