This meme is a humorous take on the idea that one's investment portfolio would be better off if they were to live in a different time and place. The text at the top reads "I would go to Wall Street if..." and the four images below show different scenarios, with the corresponding text: "this was the stock market", "this was the net growth", "these were the workers", and "this was the market". The meme is poking fun at the idea that one's financial situation would be better if they were to live in a different time and place, with each image showing a different scenario.
