This meme is a humorous comparison between a person's expected post-apocalyptic outfit and the actual reality. The text at the top reads, "What I expected my apocalyptic outfit to look like vs what it is." The image on the left shows a woman in a tough, sci-fi inspired outfit, while the images on the right show a woman in a simple, practical outfit, feeding chickens in a rural setting.
