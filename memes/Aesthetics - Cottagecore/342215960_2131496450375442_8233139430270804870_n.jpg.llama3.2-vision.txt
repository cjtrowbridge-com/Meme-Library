The meme is a comic strip that illustrates the changing nature of work and technology over time. The first panel shows a conversation between a junior and a senior, with the junior asking "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" The second panel shows the senior working in a traditional office, while the third panel shows the junior working in a modern, high-tech environment. The final panel shows a farmer working in a field, with the text "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" appearing again, implying that the answer is "as a farmer".
