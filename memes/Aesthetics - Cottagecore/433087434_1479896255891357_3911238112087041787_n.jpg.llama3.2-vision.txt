The meme features a photo of the three main characters from the movie "Mean Girls" (Cady, Regina, and Gretchen) from a specific scene. The text "Me trying to fit in with other females" appears above the image. The image is modified to show a chicken (a hen) standing on the shoulder of the character played by Lacey, with the other two characters looking at her with a mix of confusion and annoyance.
