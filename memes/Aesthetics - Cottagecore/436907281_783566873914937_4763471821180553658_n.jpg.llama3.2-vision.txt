The meme is a humorous image of a young boy with his hand on his forehead, looking puzzled. The text above him reads "DAMN... I kinda no longer wish to participate in society". The meme is likely used to express frustration or annoyance with the demands or expectations of society, and the boy's facial expression is a comedic way to convey that feeling.
