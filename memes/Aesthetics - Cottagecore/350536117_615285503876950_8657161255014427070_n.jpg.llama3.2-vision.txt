This meme is a visual joke that uses a picture of a tree that has fallen over, but still has a few branches and leaves that are still alive. The text that appears in the image says "When you fall, but you don't give up" and is written in a way that the word "fall" is in a different color than the rest of the text, and the word "don't" is in a different color than the rest of the text. The meme is making a humorous point about perseverance and resilience.
