The meme is a humorous and darkly satirical image featuring a dilapidated and eerie-looking Victorian-style greenhouse with a broken and twisted iron staircase. The text overlaid on the image reads: "collapse has its costs to those / tragically stuck inside / it's a rotting corpse / but it doesn't mean we can't have both / knives and flowers / while inside / the belly of the beast." The image is meant to be a darkly humorous and ironic commentary on the human experience of pain and suffering.
