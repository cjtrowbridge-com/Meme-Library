<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the idea that one&#x27;s investment portfolio would be better off if they were to live in a different time and place. The text at the top reads &quot;I would go to Wall Street if...&quot; and the four images below show different scenarios, with the corresponding text: &quot;this was the stock market&quot;, &quot;this was the net growth&quot;, &quot;these were the workers&quot;, and &quot;this was the market&quot;. The meme is poking fun at the idea that one&#x27;s financial situation would be better if they were to live in a different time and place, with each image showing a different scenario.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">| would go to wallstreet if oe oA Lie as a Ss Lin a ba this was the stock this was the net growth = Geman eg ieee ake ie ees â€™ ee 7 \ these were the workers this was the market</p>
