<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous commentary on the societal expectation of needing a job. It features an image of three women on a beach, but instead of being in a beach setting, they are actually in a painting of a beach, and they&#x27;re all nude. The text at the top of the image reads, &quot;Why do humans need jobs, why can&#x27;t I just sit on a beach with my tits out and stare into the ocean until I die?&quot; The image is a satirical take on the idea that people are forced to work for a living, and it&#x27;s meant to be humorous and relatable.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">= r eT ee i —— wes eg SE sa a Ss a a ee ee ——Why ce an’ just sit on-z reach ee Se r = matey, i ~~ the ocean untiltdie?.&quot; 5. ee &amp; &lt;a! amas pw aes ee Se = Ne Ser Ee ace wey te j — : j : ie yo</p>
