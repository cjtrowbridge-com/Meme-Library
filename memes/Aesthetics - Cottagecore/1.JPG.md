<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The image is a collage of multiple scenes from the anime &quot;Spirited Away&quot; by Studio Ghibo. The text &quot;I have a 100% success rate&quot; is written at the top, followed by &quot;I&#x27;ve never lost a bet&quot;. The image is a humorous commentary on the idea of a person who has never lost a bet, but is actually a terrible person.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">2S RI cai al ae i t Ve ales oe ae oe oe. a. eo 3 ea - SOE nt ne ee i ae a hse’ er OES ES EB tS a 5 ccna ei SC a, | eee ee = Tota St ae) wed 24 Nee i ere | Sats « op Nsere Beh ote eee oe ee a fe Age Pes h Se Sa DS ee 5 RS A ae ee? ae 8 * a ee. eae Sa ly? ee Be ck Seer Cae) Be jk A Pe tmany ) oes UE EY ete AS ety Pm es. oe Gee Oe FOIE, ARN 5S Hae \ LD en ee 3 ENS A Re ee WP nT Oe hee a en.) | oes See a % iQ at he hy ac Wy ee ee le cn ‘ ct ra ED fo?
