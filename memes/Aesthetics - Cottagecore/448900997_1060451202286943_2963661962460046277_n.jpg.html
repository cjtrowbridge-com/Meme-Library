<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous take on the stereotype that anarcho-activists are often associated with environmentalism and living in harmony with nature. The image features a quote that says &quot;yes i am an extremely radical anarchist&quot; followed by &quot;quietly waters plants&quot;, implying that the speaker&#x27;s radicalism is not as extreme as they think, and they&#x27;re actually just a gentle gardener. The meme pokes fun at the idea that anarcho-activists are not as radical as they claim to be, and instead are just ordinary people who enjoy gardening.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
