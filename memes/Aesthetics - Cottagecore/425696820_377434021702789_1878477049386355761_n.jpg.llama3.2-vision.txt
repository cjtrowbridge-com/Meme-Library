This meme is a picture of a wooden frame for a house, specifically an A-frame, with a caption that reads "When you finally get to work on your project, but you realize you've been building the wrong house." The image is likely a humorous take on the frustration of making a mistake in a project, and the caption is a clever play on the idea of building the wrong house, which is a common mistake in construction.
