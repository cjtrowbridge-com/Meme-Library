The meme depicts a person using a portable toilet in a desert setting, with a solar panel on top of the toilet. The text "I'm not saying I'm a genius, I'm just saying I'm not using a battery" appears in the image, implying that the person is using the solar panel to power the toilet. The humor comes from the absurdity of using a solar panel to power a toilet in the middle of a desert.
