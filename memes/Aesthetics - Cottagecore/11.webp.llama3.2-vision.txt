The meme is a humorous image of a futuristic city, with a large, sprawling metropolis in the background and a small, quaint, and idyllic rural town in the foreground. The text "I don't want to live in the city. I want to live in the countryside." is written in a playful, childlike font, as if a child is speaking. The image is meant to poke fun at the idea that someone would want to live in a small, rural town, but is actually a commentary on the urban vs. rural lifestyle.
