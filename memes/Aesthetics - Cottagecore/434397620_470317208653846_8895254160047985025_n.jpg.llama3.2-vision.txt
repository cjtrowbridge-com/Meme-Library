The meme is an image of a small, two-story wooden house with a large, sloping roof and a deck on the second floor. The text "I'm not lazy, I'm just on energy-saving mode" appears in the image, implying that the house is so small and efficient that it doesn't need to use much energy. The humor comes from the idea that the house is so tiny and efficient that it's like a person who is just conserving energy.
