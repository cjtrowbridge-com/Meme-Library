<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous and satirical take on the idea of dating in the modern era. The image shows an old man (Grandpa) watching a young woman (the &quot;me&quot; in the meme) working in a field, with a caption that reads &quot;You won&#x27;t get anything done, you&#x27;re just going to get in the way.&quot; The text on the image reads &quot;Me, every time I&#x27;m trying to work on a project&quot; and &quot;You won&#x27;t get anything done, you&#x27;re just going to get in the way.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">“ee (49 Boe Oe oe a ee aetna a fet ide Pere = yi ” SIPeutte0 «. eee the farm and dating &#123; /&#125; ghost | Pheaty ee ee ee — a 4 Coy enemas? x&#125; hi; fred a p i bs | Cee ee eer Mia? t , ; F y a ee  “You won&#x27;t getanything done-hoeingylike that~ ‘ .
