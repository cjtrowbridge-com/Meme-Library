<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous and satirical take on the common phrase &quot;If you don&#x27;t like something, don&#x27;t do it.&quot; The image presents a series of absurd and humorous statements that are the opposite of the original phrase, such as &quot;If you like sand, go to the beach&quot; and &quot;If you like cats, pet them.&quot; The text is written in a playful, tongue-in-cheek style, with each statement ending with a humorous and absurd &quot;if&quot; clause.</p>
