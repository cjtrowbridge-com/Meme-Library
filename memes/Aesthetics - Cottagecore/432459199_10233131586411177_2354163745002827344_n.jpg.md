<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous and slightly provocative image that pokes fun at the idea of building a homestead with someone. The text in the image reads: &quot;horny but for someone to build a homestead with me &amp; live consciously in alignment with the seasons.&quot; The image is likely a playful and cheeky take on the idea of building a home and living in harmony with nature.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ree iY gels Fh i APES SoS yy ha “Aiea Rn ie ChE) a ‘ee eee Be A as cd A &#125; y Lay) q ae SRN eee Ee Or e PW? = Pen Qrs-: Dial tee. php aK RPO &amp; meone to. er melliey kele re Cel toe eae gee oat dase Say eadtel ae Sh) a iD pe 5 get ott Rea ee te calle e- © ns am , “&#125; &#x27; ° (live cons all Me SI MLL LD Fa We ost ai eo 1 VATS hye cee eg eo Mf, a led ha _ Mie Lemtin ihe — Pon aie SA Ae Rg</p>
