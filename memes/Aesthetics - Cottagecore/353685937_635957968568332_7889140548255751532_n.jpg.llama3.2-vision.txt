The meme is a humorous comparison between the before and after of a lawn. It shows a house with a lawn in the "before" picture, and a house with a garden in the "after" picture, with a caption that says "Two years of progress converting a water dependent lawn to native plants using a lawn removal rebate from the water company, Southern California". The joke is that the house's lawn has been replaced with a garden, implying that the owner has made a successful effort to reduce their water usage.
