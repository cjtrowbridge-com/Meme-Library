<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the relationship between wealth and exploitation. The image shows a scene from the animated film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; where a character is being held by a group of wealthy, powerful people. The text overlays the image, stating &quot;we don&#x27;t exist to be exploited by billionaires&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
