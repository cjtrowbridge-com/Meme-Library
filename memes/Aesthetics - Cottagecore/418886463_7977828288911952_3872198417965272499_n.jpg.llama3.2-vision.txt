The meme is a humorous commentary on the concept of "foodscaping" or "foodscaping" (a mix-up of "food" and "landscaping"), where each yard has a vegetable garden with fruit trees. The image is an aerial view of a densely populated neighborhood, with each yard filled with lush greenery and trees, creating a beautiful and vibrant landscape. The text at the top of the image reads: "This is called 'Foodscaping'. Each yard has a vegetable garden with fruit trees. Neighbors consult with each other so they can trade the food that is grown. Imagine if people did this everywhere."
