<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a satirical image that presents a futuristic, eco-friendly house called the &quot;Hemp House.&quot; The text above the image reads, &quot;Hemp House: Walls made with Hempcrete, Solar Windows made with Hemp Plastic, Hempcrete is more energy efficient than concrete.&quot; Below the image, it says, &quot;Hempcrete is mildew resistant, termite resistant, an excellent sound isolator, and breathable insulator.&quot; The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that a house made of hemp is the ultimate eco-friendly and sustainable home.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
