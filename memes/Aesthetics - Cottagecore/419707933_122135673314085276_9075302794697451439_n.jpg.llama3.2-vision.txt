This meme is a humorous take on the phrase "I'm not quite at this level, but..." It features a photo of a house made entirely of coffee cups, with the caption "I'm not quite at this level, but some day I may be able to build my coffee mug house too." The image is a humorous commentary on the idea that someone's ambition to build a house made of coffee cups is not yet a reality.
