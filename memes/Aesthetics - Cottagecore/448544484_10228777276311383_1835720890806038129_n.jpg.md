<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous and darkly ironic image with the text: &quot;Change is hard. But, staying somewhere you don&#x27;t belong will literally destroy you.&quot; The image is likely a dark or eerie landscape, such as a forest or abandoned building, with the text appearing in a bold, neon-like font. The overall tone is meant to be humorous and satirical, poking fun at the idea that people often struggle with change, but also that staying in a situation that&#x27;s not right for you can be disastrous.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Re NSA 3 o &#125; bot ee te x ‘+. ou gee £3) e ae &gt; &lt; Re nace fe ae ri Se v. a eee eS ~~ x -* ee St a ts A any y e PPO RE an ee aa leet as ; mf - e een aN 3 oy) ee h-- ™ i) wa . ae eae ma Rohe: tiple ar - oT meat a</p>
