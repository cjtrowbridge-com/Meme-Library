<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous illustration of a post-apocalyptic village where people have adapted to survive. The image shows a diverse group of people, including farmers, craftsmen, and medical professionals, working together to build a community. The text at the bottom of the image reads, &quot;Why is it that everyone I meet, that expects a pending societal collapse, is focused on weapons? Do you have seeds? Do you have tools? Do you know how to filter water? Where are your crafters? Who can blacksmith, who can sew, who can heal? We won&#x27;t survive a collapse by killing each other. We need to work together.&quot;</p>
