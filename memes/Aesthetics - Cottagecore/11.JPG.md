<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous image of a futuristic city, but it&#x27;s actually a farming village. The text at the top of the image reads &quot;We are not a city, we are a village of farmers&quot; and the bottom text says &quot;We have 1000 years of experience in not being a city&quot;. The image is poking fun at the idea of a city being a futuristic, high-tech place, and instead shows a village of farmers who have been doing the same thing for 1000 years.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
