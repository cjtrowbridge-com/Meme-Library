<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a visual representation of a tree with multiple houses, each representing a different family member. The image shows a tree with multiple branches, each one leading to a house with a different family member&#x27;s name on the door. The text on the image reads: &quot;We have a house for every family member, but we still can&#x27;t find the one for the in-laws.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
