<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a futuristic city, with a large, sprawling metropolis in the background and a small, quaint, and idyllic rural town in the foreground. The text &quot;I don&#x27;t want to live in the city. I want to live in the countryside.&quot; is written in a playful, childlike font, as if a child is speaking. The image is meant to poke fun at the idea that someone would want to live in a small, rural town, but is actually a commentary on the urban vs. rural lifestyle.</p>
