This meme is a humorous image of a Canadian homeowner who has taken a drastic approach to keeping their property secure. The image shows a house with a sign that reads "I have a 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence, 10 foot fence" with a red "X" through each one, implying the homeowner has replaced each of their fences with a sign saying "I have a 10 foot fence". The text above the image reads "Canadian homeowner built a path instead of a fence when he noticed locals cutting through his property".
