This meme is a humorous image of a futuristic city, but it's actually a farming village. The text at the top of the image reads "We are not a city, we are a village of farmers" and the bottom text says "We have 1000 years of experience in not being a city". The image is poking fun at the idea of a city being a futuristic, high-tech place, and instead shows a village of farmers who have been doing the same thing for 1000 years.
