<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the current state of the internet. It features a photo of a therapist&#x27;s office, with the therapist and patient sitting on a couch, but with a twist: the patient is not sitting on the couch, but is instead lying on a couch-like bed that is actually a giant mushroom. The text above the image reads: &quot;And is this the global mycelial network in the room with us right now?&quot; The joke is that the therapist is asking a question that is both literal and metaphorical, referencing the idea that the internet is a global network of interconnected computers that can be thought of as a &quot;mushroom&quot; that is spreading and growing in the &quot;room&quot; of the internet.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">“And is this global mycelial network in the room with us right now?” ti () Sar N = ae a yy. 7 1 - iis. * \ — p &gt;A / # ms iN | . iD  gyal’ 13 9  @tricycleday , &amp; a =</p>
