The meme is an image of a small, modern, A-frame house with a car parked in front of it. The text "I'm not lazy, I'm just on energy-saving mode" appears on the screen of a phone in the car's window. The meme is a humorous way to describe being tired or needing to conserve energy, like a car's low-power mode.
