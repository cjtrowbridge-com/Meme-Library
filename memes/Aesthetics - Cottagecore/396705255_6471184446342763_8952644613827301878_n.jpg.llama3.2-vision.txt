The meme is a humorous illustration of a tree with a face and a speech bubble, surrounded by a jungle-like environment. The text "The actual trouble is that profit is identified entirely with money, as distinct from the real profit of living with dignity and elegance in beautiful surroundings." is superimposed over the image. The image is likely meant to be humorous and satirical, poking fun at the idea that profit is often prioritized over other values.
