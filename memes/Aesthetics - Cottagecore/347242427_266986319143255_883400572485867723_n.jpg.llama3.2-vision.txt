This meme is a humorous take on the concept of individualism and the idea that it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The text on the left says, "They sell us individualist philosophy," and the text on the right says, "Because we can't defeat them alone." The image is likely a still from a popular anime or cartoon, showing a character looking out of a window or a window-like structure, with a determined or sad expression. The character is likely a protagonist or hero, and the image is meant to convey the idea that even when we are alone, we can still be a threat to others.
