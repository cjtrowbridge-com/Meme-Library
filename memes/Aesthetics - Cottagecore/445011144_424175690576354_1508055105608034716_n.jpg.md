<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of Frederick Douglass, a former slave who became a prominent abolitionist, with a quote that reads: &quot;Knowledge makes the man unfit to be a slave.&quot; The image is likely meant to be ironic or satirical, suggesting that knowledge or education can actually make a person more aware of their own oppression and the need for freedom.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">TSO SS ite oe aes * a eres ioe . ie ee con ai ieee ne * Â¥ boa is i, a , ae ee ee Sg eS a a koe Pa ee wo c Knowledge makes the man s oP unfit to be a slave.
