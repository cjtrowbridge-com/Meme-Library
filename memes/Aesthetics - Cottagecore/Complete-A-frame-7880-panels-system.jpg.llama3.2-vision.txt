The meme is a photo of a solar panel installation in a rural area, with a sign in the foreground that reads "Solar Panel: 1.5kW, 2.5kW, 3.5kW, 4.5kW, 5.5kW...". The image is humorous because it implies that the solar panel installation is trying to be too efficient and is actually a bit too powerful for its own good.
