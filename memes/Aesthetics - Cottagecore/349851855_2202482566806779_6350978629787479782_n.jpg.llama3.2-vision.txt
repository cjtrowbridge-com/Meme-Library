This meme is a humorous image of a small, rustic garden with a few rows of vegetables and a small wooden shed in the background. The text "Don't call it a dream, call it a plan" appears in a large, white font at the top of the image. The image is meant to be ironic, implying that the garden is not just a dream, but a well-planned and successful project.
