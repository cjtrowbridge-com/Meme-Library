This meme features a wizard-like character from the Harry Potter series, but instead of a wand, he's holding a gun. The text "I cast" is at the top, and the bottom reads "Non-Magic Missile". The image is a humorous take on the idea that even a wizard can't always control his magic, and in this case, he's using a non-magical, or non-mystical, missile to get the job done.
