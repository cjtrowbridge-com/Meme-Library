<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme depicts a person using a portable toilet in a desert setting, with a solar panel on top of the toilet. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m a genius, I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;m not using a battery&quot; appears in the image, implying that the person is using the solar panel to power the toilet. The humor comes from the absurdity of using a solar panel to power a toilet in the middle of a desert.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ie ral — ak si ae “ .e) - , = 3 = Bere tt | 8 sens . | Wii— Bg OE</p>
