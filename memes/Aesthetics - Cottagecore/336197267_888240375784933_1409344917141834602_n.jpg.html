<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the modern human experience. The text reads, &quot;Damn can you imagine being a human during the paleolithic age just eating salmon and berries and storytelling around campfires and star gazing... no jobs, no traffic, no ads, no poverty, no capitalism, no trauma, just pure vibes.&quot; The meme pokes fun at the idea of how much simpler and more peaceful life was in the past, compared to the modern world&#x27;s many stresses and complexities.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
<p>@ Robert Raymond  y @robpertray Damn can you imagine being a human during the paleolithic age just eating salmon and berries and storytelling around campfires and star gazing ... no jobs no traffic no ads no poverty no capitalism- caused traumas just pure vibes</p>
