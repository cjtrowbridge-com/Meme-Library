<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a photo of a small, modern house made from a shipping container, with a sleek and minimalist design. The text &quot;I just got a new house and I&#x27;m so excited to finally have a place to store all my stuff&quot; is written in a childlike, scribbled font on a whiteboard on the wall. The image is a humorous commentary on the idea of a &quot;new house&quot; being a shipping container, implying that the person is not actually moving into a traditional home.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">SE SSS —— a “ee iT Au it IF eo . eae</p>
