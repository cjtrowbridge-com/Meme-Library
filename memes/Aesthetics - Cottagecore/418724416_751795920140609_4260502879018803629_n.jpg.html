<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a before-and-after comparison of a house. The &quot;before&quot; image is a photo of a house made entirely out of shipping containers, with empty spaces and no interior. The &quot;after&quot; image is a photo of a completed, modern home with a beautiful interior, with the text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just reorganizing my space&quot; appearing above it.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
