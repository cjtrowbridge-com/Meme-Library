This meme is a visual representation of a city's infrastructure being completely overgrown by nature. The image shows a city's roads, buildings, and infrastructure being covered in lush greenery, with trees and vines crawling over everything. The text "I'm not saying we're not doing anything, I'm just saying we're doing it differently" appears in the image, implying that the city is being taken over by nature in a way that is not being actively controlled.
