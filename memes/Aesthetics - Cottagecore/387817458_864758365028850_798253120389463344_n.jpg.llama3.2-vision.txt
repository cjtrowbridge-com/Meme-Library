The meme is a joke about the idea of a "commune" (a community living together) being taken over by a group of "commies" (a pejorative term for communists). The text in the image reads "owning the commies by living in a commune" and is followed by an image of a green, lush garden with a house and a greenhouse. The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, suggesting that the owners of the commune are actually the ones in charge, rather than the "commies" they are trying to control.
