This meme is a humorous image that juxtaposes a serene and peaceful scene of a pond with a famous painting by Claude Monet, "The Water Lilies," with a quote that seems to be a misquote of the actual quote "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." The actual quote is not present in the image. The actual quote is a quote from the famous artist, and the image is a quote from the famous artist.
