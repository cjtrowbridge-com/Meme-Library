<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the changing nature of food production and consumption in the United States. It presents a series of increasingly absurd and humorous statements about the history of American food habits, starting with a 19th-century scenario where 50% of Americans were farmers, followed by a 1945 scenario where Americans were growing 45% of their food in their backyards, and finally a 2020 scenario where Americans were growing 0.1% of their food in their backyards. The text is presented in a playful, tongue-in-ear  style, with the company&#x27;s name and a  @naturesupplyco  handle.

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">‘ setitmesanid nile a a 2 24% Nature Supply Co abe cae m  | 1800 - 50% of Americans were farming = == 1945 - Americans grew 45% of their food u coe ; Tes sea in their backyard gardens ake os s  2020 - Americans grow .1% of their food By met in their backyard gardens. ss vs ‘: Par sie al a &gt; hi &#125; Py a a ig ; ‘eS ws &gt; we AY.
