<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a picture of a cozy room with a high ceiling, featuring a comfortable-looking couch, a bookshelf, and a guitar. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just on energy-saving mode&quot; is written in a playful, cursive font above the couch. The image is meant to be humorous, suggesting that the person is simply conserving energy, rather than being lazy.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">oN ‘ NY \ —— A ae ~ YY . : ia): aS My aay TN S| 7p 7) : rE | ir yA iy :~ &gt;&lt; eno WAP ay S »~ ee | ees a Yj ae Mo ‘i ne — “4 bie wy id) &gt;» wT TL nr wae tf | NN | wie Ne) 5 ; a B By 3 fg WU) A ae NE YP [tint Ry i ul. is SY ed) ES 1m), aoe ah ye it aver AGS Sag!
