<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the concept of a meeting where everyone is too focused on their own work to engage with others. The text reads, &quot;This meeting could&#x27;ve been a nutrient exchange between the mycelium networks beneath an old growth forest.&quot; The idea is that instead of a meeting, it could have been a chance for the mycelium networks to exchange nutrients, which is a clever and humorous way to poke fun at the idea of a meeting.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Mea aed a &lt; 6s ago This meeting could&#x27;ve been a nutrient exchange between the mycelium networks beneath an old growth forest</p>
