This meme features a photo of a white opossum wearing a cowboy hat, accompanied by a quote in a western-style font. The text reads: "I SPIT I CUSS DAMN SURE RAISE A FUSS BUT MOST OF ALL I ADVOCATE FOR THE TOTAL EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASS." The image is humorous and ironic, as it juxtaposes a typical western-style quote with a reference to a working-class movement, while also featuring an opossum, an animal not typically associated with the western genre.
