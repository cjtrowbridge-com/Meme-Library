<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a picture of a tiny house made from a shipping container, with a small deck and a hot tub. The caption reads &quot;When you finally get your own home, but it&#x27;s still a shipping container&quot;. The image is humorous because it pokes fun at the idea of living in a small, cramped space, even when it&#x27;s your own home.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
