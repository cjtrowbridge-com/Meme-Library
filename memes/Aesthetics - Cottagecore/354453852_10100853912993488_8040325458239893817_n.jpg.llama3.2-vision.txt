This meme is a humorous commentary on the idea of "sustainable living" in a hyper-ironic and satirical way. The first panel shows a person marveling at the plants on a building, with the text "Wow, so progressive!" The second panel shows a person looking at a small house in a garden, with the text "Ew, flyover country." The meme is poking fun at the idea that "sustainable living" is often associated with high-end, modern, and luxurious buildings, while "sustainable living" in a small, rural, or "flyover" area is often seen as a less-appearing, less-pleasing, and less-pleasant place.
