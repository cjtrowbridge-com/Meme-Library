This meme is a humorous image of a house in the middle of a lush, green garden, with a large vegetable garden in the foreground. The text at the top reads "THE GOAL ISN'T GUCCI BAGS" and the text at the bottom reads "IT'S ACRES OF LAND". The meme is making a humorous comparison between the idea of achieving wealth and success through material possessions (Gucci bags) versus having a successful and fulfilling life through hard work and self-sufficiency (owning a large piece of land and growing your own food).
