<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous commentary on the relationship between a developer&#x27;s intentions and the actual outcome of their work. The image shows a character with a &quot;broken&quot; expression and a &quot;working as intended&quot; expression, with the text &quot;The system is broken and must be fixed&quot; and &quot;The system is working exactly as intended and must be destroyed&quot;. The meme pokes fun at the idea that a system can be both broken and working as intended at the same time, highlighting the absurdity of this situation.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">eo Fo AY \N 2 8., \ The system d, i JS i. ys i) = is broken ys and must be fixed = ip C~ / gv, Ze ti The system is working Zi — exactly as AS Gi - intended and y ~/ ar must be destroyed i CL &#x27;¢@</p>
