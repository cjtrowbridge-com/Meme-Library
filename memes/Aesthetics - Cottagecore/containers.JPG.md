<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a screenshot of a Facebook post from a page called &quot;Off Grid Living &amp; Survival&quot;. The post is titled &quot;Container Home&quot; and features a 3D rendering of a house made from shipping containers, with a caption that reads &quot;Container Home&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ee Off Grid Living &amp; Survival «a X Ig) George Mar: 49m-@ Container Home @ TT — i TM ia Mh jie [ aati = ol as MIT He TT ie - Lit, Fe | —_ PL. a af aul ~ LYS</p>
