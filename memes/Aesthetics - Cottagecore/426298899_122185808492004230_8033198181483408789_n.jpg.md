<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a photo of a person wearing a ridiculous outfit, including a large hat and a sign that says &quot;Trespassers will be composted&quot;. The image is humorous because it&#x27;s a playful take on the traditional &quot;Trespassers will be prosecuted&quot; sign, with a humorous and absurd twist. The text &quot;Trespassers will be composted&quot; is a clever and witty way to poke fun at the idea of a serious warning sign.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">all oy 4 | — = J 7 as es - oA : s | ONES ake B = / y F E a ¥ 4 es . : , re 7 ESD A SE S WILLB , a i .
