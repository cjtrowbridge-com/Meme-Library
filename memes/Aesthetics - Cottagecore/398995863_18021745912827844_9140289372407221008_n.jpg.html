<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme features a cozy cabin interior with a couch, a bookshelf, and a loft bed. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just conserving energy for my next adventure&quot; appears above the couch, implying that the person is not being lazy, but rather preparing for a future activity. The image is meant to be humorous and relatable, poking fun at the idea that people often use &quot;I&#x27;m just conserving energy&quot; as an excuse for laziness.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
