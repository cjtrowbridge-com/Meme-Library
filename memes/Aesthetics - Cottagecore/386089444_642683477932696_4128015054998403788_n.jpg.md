<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous commentary on the trend of naming children after celebrities and brands. The image shows a child in a garden, surrounded by flowers and a windmill, with a quote that says &quot;Let&#x27;s raise kids who can name more plants and animals than celebrities and brand names.&quot; The image is a playful way to encourage parents to teach their children about the natural world, rather than the latest pop culture trends.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">= ee a ty ee ee we — &amp; “Let’s raiae-kids who ci ‘Mle ey Peas ict F bee .
