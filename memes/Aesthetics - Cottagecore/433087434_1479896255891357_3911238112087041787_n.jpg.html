<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme features a photo of the three main characters from the movie &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (Cady, Regina, and Gretchen) from a specific scene. The text &quot;Me trying to fit in with other females&quot; appears above the image. The image is modified to show a chicken (a hen) standing on the shoulder of the character played by Lacey, with the other two characters looking at her with a mix of confusion and annoyance.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
