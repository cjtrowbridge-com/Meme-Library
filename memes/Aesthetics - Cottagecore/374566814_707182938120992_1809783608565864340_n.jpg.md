<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous illustration of a suburban neighborhood that has been transformed into a sustainable, eco-friendly community. The text &quot;Repair Suburbia&quot; is written at the top, and the image shows a series of houses with solar panels, wind turbines, and a community garden. The text &quot;Less lawn, more planet&quot; is written at the bottom, and the image also includes labels such as &quot;rain barrels&quot;, &quot;community compost bins&quot;, &quot;clean water canals&quot;, and &quot;native plants&quot; to describe the various sustainable features of the community.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ps BS) ie: mat jepair Suburbia tw , less lawn, more planet a &lt; ro FS ~~ \ Es iia, vy ot eo pas Zi (| Ve Y- \ | ZN Ya . m na FF cain SWE. | y , barrels Tl community, 5 Melty oot ik —— i i | Sal | a) / il 4 b Sk ot Cm f bd Ve aes Clean water 4 : ae © Canals Native Plant&#x27;s 1 j ¥ (earousn Prairies y j . eg e B/</p>
