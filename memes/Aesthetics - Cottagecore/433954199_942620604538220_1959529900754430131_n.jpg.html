<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a drawing of a small, self-sustaining village, with various buildings and gardens, including a wind turbine, a solar panel, and a composting toilet. The text &quot;Permaculture&quot; appears at the top, and the image is surrounded by a caption that says &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just...&quot;. The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, suggesting that the person is not actually living off the land, but rather has just been very careful to plan and prepare for their own self-sufficiency.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
