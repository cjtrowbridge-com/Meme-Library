This meme is a play on the classic country song "Redneck" by the country music group "Y'All" (also known as "Y'all" with an "i" instead of an "a"). The image features a banjo and a shovel crossed over each other, with the words "Y'All" and "Puttin' the red back in redneck" written above and below the image.
