This meme is a humorous comparison between the typical 30-minute workday and a 6-hour workday in a garden. The left panel shows a person sleeping on a construction site, implying a long and exhausting workday. The right panel shows a person with a "Skunk Ape" mask, implying a long and exhausting day in a garden. The text "Skunk Ape Liberation Union" is likely a joke about the person's job being so exhausting that they're seeking a new job.
