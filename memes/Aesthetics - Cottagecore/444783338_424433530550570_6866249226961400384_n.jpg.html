<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme features a quote from the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno, known for his paradoxical views on the nature of reality. The quote &quot;Well-being is not a single, well-ordered, and simple thing&quot; is not present in the meme. The meme contains a quote from Zeno, but the quote is not present.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
