This meme is a split-image comparison of two illustrations. The top image depicts a beautiful woman in a lush garden, surrounded by flowers and trees, with a gentle expression on her face. The text "I'm not a gardener, I'm a gardener-er" is written above her.

The bottom image shows a chaotic and disheveled garden, with weeds and trash scattered everywhere. The text "I'm not a gardener, I'm a gard-ner" is written above it.

The meme is a humorous comparison of two different approaches to gardening, with the top image representing a peaceful and organized approach, and the bottom image representing a chaotic and disorganized approach.
