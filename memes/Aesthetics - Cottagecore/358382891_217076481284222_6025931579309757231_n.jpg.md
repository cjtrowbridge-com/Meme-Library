<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a play on the phrase &quot;is this a joke?&quot; It features a character from the anime &quot;Lucky Star&quot; in a state of confusion, with a speech bubble saying &quot;Is this freedom?&quot; The text at the top reads &quot;Men who literally owned enslaved human beings&quot; and the text at the bottom reads &quot;A piece of paper in 1776.&quot; The meme is a commentary on the irony that the US Declaration of Independence, which is often seen as a symbol of American freedom, was written by and for people who owned slaves. The character&#x27;s confusion and question is a humorous way of pointing out the hypocrisy of the founding fathers.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">fcelvaneen XK an LEN EV UE Tay Mp. fi PITTA: ‘iy; yy Rc , z A y F , IS THIS FREEDOM?</p>
