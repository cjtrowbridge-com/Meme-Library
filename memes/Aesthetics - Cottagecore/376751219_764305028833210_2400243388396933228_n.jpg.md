<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a character from the anime &quot;Kill La Kill&quot; in a humorous and relatable scenario. The text at the top reads, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be at work?&quot; and the character responds with a sarcastic and humorous explanation of her current situation, listing various excuses for why she&#x27;s not at work. The text is written in a playful, internet-style format, with a mix of humor and irony.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">cane vr ‘an rot WoL PEVE MOLL soe rs A ay Rae umm lim aes MOI DMe aA Cis community ‘of people who knows Wi ies 8%- .. 4 ae TANS ee ANECSN other by name and) GiruG SCENE yi Deets arg Weld e-U Ur NLC MRT 7 eye ay Li&#123;\&gt; EMO PUTT baybeee .</p>
