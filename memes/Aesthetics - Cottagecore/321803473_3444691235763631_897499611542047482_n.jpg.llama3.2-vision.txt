The meme is a humorous tweet that expresses frustration with the idea that humans were born on a planet that has a perfect environment for growing food, yet they still have to deal with financial issues and have a bad credit score. The text reads: "We were born on a planet that can grow food in every direction, and we're still f**king up so bad that I got a credit score."
