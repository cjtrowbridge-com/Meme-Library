This meme is a humorous take on the idea that some people's jobs or careers are not as exciting or fulfilling as they would like. The text "Not interested in a 'career' just looking for the least annoying way to pay the bills" is a tongue-in-cheek expression of this sentiment. The image is likely a humorous or relatable image, but the text itself is the focus of the meme.
