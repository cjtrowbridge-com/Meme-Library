This meme is a humorous image of a couple walking together, with the woman eating a snack and the man carrying a cat in a strange, makeshift "pouch" made from his overalls. The image is captioned "If this isn't the future you want, I'm not interested." The joke is that the man is so committed to his relationship that he's willing to carry a cat in his clothes, even if it's not the most practical or comfortable solution.
