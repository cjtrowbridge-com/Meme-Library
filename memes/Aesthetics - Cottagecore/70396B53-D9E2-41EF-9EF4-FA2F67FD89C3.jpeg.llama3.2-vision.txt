This meme is a humorous image of a man in a 19th-century-style painting, specifically "The Angelus" by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. The image shows a man standing in a field, holding a pitchfork, with a look of intense frustration. The text "I'm not lazy, I'm just on [insert time]!" is written above the man's head, implying that he's not actually working, but rather taking a break.
