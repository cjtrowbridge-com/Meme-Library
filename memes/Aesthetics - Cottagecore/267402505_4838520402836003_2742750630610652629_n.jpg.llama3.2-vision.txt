This meme is a humorous comparison between two contrasting images. The top image depicts a medieval-style scene with a monk, a castle, and a crowd of people, with the text "THE OLD WORLD IS ENDING..." above it. The bottom image shows a post-apocalyptic scene with a group of people living in a new, sustainable environment, with the text "A NEW EARTH IS FORMING..." above it. The meme is meant to be humorous and satirical, suggesting that the old world is ending and a new, better world is being formed.
