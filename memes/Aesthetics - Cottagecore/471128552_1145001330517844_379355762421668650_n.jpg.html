<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a picture of a person looking at a small, old-fashioned house in the middle of a forest. The text &quot;DO YOU EVER JUST&quot; is written in bold, pink letters across the top of the image. Below the text, a question mark is shown, implying that the person is asking if anyone ever just... something, but the rest of the sentence is cut off.</p>
