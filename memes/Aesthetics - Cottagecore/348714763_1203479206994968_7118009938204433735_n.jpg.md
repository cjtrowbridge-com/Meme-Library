<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The image features a quote from Alan Watts, a philosopher and writer, alongside a black-and-white photograph of him. The quote is displayed in white text on a black background, reading: &quot;THE MOST DANGEROUS RISK OF ALL: THE RISK OF SPENDING YOUR LIFE NOT DOING WHAT YOU WANT ON THE BET YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF THE FREEDOM TO DO IT LATER.&quot; Below the quote, in smaller white text, is the attribution &quot;- Alan Watts&quot;. The image is cropped at the top and bottom, with only a portion of Alan Watts&#x27; face visible in the photograph.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">a ey cla Celt  Cog Vera aol \â€œ Shana j 3 NOT DOING WHAT YOU aa = &#125; ike hae elu | i UA Sana ao FREEDOM TODOIT 5 oan da  WN ae iy |  CUR elec So g</p>
