<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous comparison between a person&#x27;s expected post-apocalyptic outfit and the actual reality. The text at the top reads, &quot;What I expected my apocalyptic outfit to look like vs what it is.&quot; The image on the left shows a woman in a tough, sci-fi inspired outfit, while the images on the right show a woman in a simple, practical outfit, feeding chickens in a rural setting.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">What | expected my apocalyptic outtit to look like vs what it is. vr . net ad \ Pom Wt; = . . . &lt; eee he = arr = ae, § ye oe Sere ; -Fz —— ee d i. x \ 0 en oe ae = a y= sh : ck ee Tc aS pe RT Se een &gt;: gl aN Se RE ag ee ~ ne —</p>
