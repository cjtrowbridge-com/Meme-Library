The meme is an image of a small, modern A-frame cabin with a large, empty space in front of it. The text "I can hear you" is written in a bold, red font in the empty space. The meme is likely referencing the idea that someone is trying to be quiet and not be heard, but the "I can hear you" text suggests that someone is still aware of their presence.
