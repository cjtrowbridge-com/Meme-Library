<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a library with a large, abandoned library with a massive, overgrown library with a large, overgrown library with a large, overgrown library. The text in the image reads: &quot;I&#x27;m not arguing, I&#x27;m just explaining why I&#x27;m right.&quot; The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, poking fun at the idea of a library being a place of learning and knowledge, but instead being a place of overgrowth and decay.</p>

<h2>first-seen</h2>
<p title="Because Git doesn't preserve file modification times, this metadata file contains the file's modification time when it was added to the library.">2023-05-31T00:51:24+00:00</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">i So ; Ne a Re CY Lo ae SS me : Sa Ae ea P Re ee .
