The meme is a humorous image of a young girl from the classic children's book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" standing in a forest, facing a large, dark, and ominous-looking creature with glowing eyes. The creature is actually the "Jabberwocky" from the book, a monster that has been brought to life by the girl's imagination. The text above the girl reads "Are we like this because we drank from the hose?"
