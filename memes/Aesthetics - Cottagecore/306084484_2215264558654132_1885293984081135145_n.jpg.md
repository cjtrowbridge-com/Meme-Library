<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous commentary on the state of human existence. The text reads: &quot;humans really could have had a beautiful little existence on earth just creating art and eating fruit. instead we have credit scores and taxes.&quot; The meme pokes fun at the idea that humans have become so focused on material wealth and financial success that we have lost the simple, simple pleasures of life.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">7&quot; Agencies humans really could have had a beautiful little existence on earth just creating art and eating fruit. instead we have credit scores and taxes</p>
