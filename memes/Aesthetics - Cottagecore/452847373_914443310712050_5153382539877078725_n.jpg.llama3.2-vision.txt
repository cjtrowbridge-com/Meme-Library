The meme is a play on the concept of "you can't have your cake and eat it too." It features a split-screen image of a tree with roots that are both connected to a cake and a mushroom. The top half of the image reads "You can't have your cake and eat it too" while the bottom half reads "You can't have your cake and eat it too, but you can have your cake and have it grow into a tree."
