This meme is a humorous take on the common phrase "I'm not a food, I'm a person." The text reads: "I am not a snack. I am a garden. Take care of me and I can feed you forever." The meme pokes fun at the idea that people often treat others like they're a snack or a meal, rather than a person with needs and feelings.
