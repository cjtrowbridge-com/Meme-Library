This meme is a humorous take on the idea that rural life in 1927 was very different from modern times. The image shows a woman in a rural setting, nursing a baby, while a goat is also nursing from her. The text above the image reads "Rural homestead life in 1927 when the mothers aren't able to breastfeed."
