<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image that juxtaposes a serious question about spiritual experiences with a terrifying and fantastical image. The text at the top reads &quot;Them: So what&#x27;s happening on your spiritual path?&quot; and the response below is simply &quot;Me:&quot;. The image that follows is a dark, eerie scene featuring a monstrous, skeletal creature with glowing eyes, and a small, frightened-looking creature in the foreground.</p>
