<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous list of tasks that are often neglected or procrastinated on, with the title &quot;Things I Do In My Spare Time&quot;. The text reads: &quot;Water plants, Buy plants, Repot plants, Propagate plants, Talk with plants, and Reroute plants&quot;. The image is not described, but the text provides a humorous and relatable list of tasks that are often neglected or procrastinated on.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">SS ae ta a ae cy BS PE WCy Om Chic) : os e ~~, a wf Lat, A) a Ih AM Ag Talk with plants | oma Rearrange plants</p>
