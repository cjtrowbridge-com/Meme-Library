<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a playful invitation to a gathering of frogs, where they&#x27;re having a party around a campfire under the moon. The image features a cartoon moon with a smiling face, surrounded by frogs in various costumes, playing instruments, and dancing. The text at the top of the image reads, &quot;Unless you&#x27;re doing whatever is going on here, please don&#x27;t invite me anywhere.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
