<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a picture of a wooden frame for a house, specifically an A-frame, with a caption that reads &quot;When you finally get to work on your project, but you realize you&#x27;ve been building the wrong house.&quot; The image is likely a humorous take on the frustration of making a mistake in a project, and the caption is a clever play on the idea of building the wrong house, which is a common mistake in construction.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">: ests a Paes bgt ’ és =: Ls Hey a zoe a a wr, oat FS &lt; ae es RE ~ ; , ‘ ee aes ‘ or a BS ) 6 \ ; Ue 7 “a “eA gia Le ESN oe a ee ee eR es 2 / y ) _ aN &amp; ag eke a fifi \ &quot;| NY nes Ss Mb) Nits bs WX by OG ven ‘| y : ped i &#123; x ; ba +H a a &#125; oN 3 ‘ i a WW Ny ei erty oe: XN e Ye ee | ee a ees * Psa pall = A p=| eae A i ——— ted A ji ——— DOS eae eee &gt; : a i owe ee</p>
