<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is an image of a small, rustic house built on top of a garden, with a large garden below it. The garden is filled with a variety of vegetables and plants, and the house has a small, wooden bridge leading to it. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just on garden time&quot; appears in the image, implying that the person is taking a break to focus on their garden rather than doing something else.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">or ond ae f — dt ead ee = Ak Re ee =) “ig ss A ft ba IY Ni : a LA See oe ope a Speeeeay, ae Se aya : » = ra ©) 4a a |S — SEEN PERTEE [ icra | Rau ] Ne saa a ere. | &#125; ll: Co a ge te aes Var aie 3 hn) ate Wh 4 Ra aa ne y ere s a Rae Niael ome.
