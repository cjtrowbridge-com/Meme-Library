<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a play on the classic country song &quot;Redneck&quot; by the country music group &quot;Y&#x27;All&quot; (also known as &quot;Y&#x27;all&quot; with an &quot;i&quot; instead of an &quot;a&quot;). The image features a banjo and a shovel crossed over each other, with the words &quot;Y&#x27;All&quot; and &quot;Puttin&#x27; the red back in redneck&quot; written above and below the image.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
