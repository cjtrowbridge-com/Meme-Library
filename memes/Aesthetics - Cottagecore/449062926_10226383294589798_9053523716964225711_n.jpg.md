<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous image of a person in their 40s or 50s, dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, watering a garden. The text &quot;Millennials skipping past the &#x27;midlife crisis phase&#x27; and right to granny hobbies&quot; is overlaid on the image, suggesting that this person has bypassed the traditional midlife crisis and is now embracing the &quot;granny&quot; lifestyle.</p>
