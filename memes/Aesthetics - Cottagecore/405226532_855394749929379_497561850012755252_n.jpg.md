<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous comparison between the typical 30-minute workday and a 6-hour workday in a garden. The left panel shows a person sleeping on a construction site, implying a long and exhausting workday. The right panel shows a person with a &quot;Skunk Ape&quot; mask, implying a long and exhausting day in a garden. The text &quot;Skunk Ape Liberation Union&quot; is likely a joke about the person&#x27;s job being so exhausting that they&#x27;re seeking a new job.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">1 yet | mo it Ts 4 Alter 20 See minutes | ae | at work fey aL m io 4 After 6 a.‚Äù hours in P i4jSsSsaee the garden hg -=</p>
