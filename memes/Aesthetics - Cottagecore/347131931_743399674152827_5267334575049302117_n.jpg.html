<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a picture of a cozy library with a large window overlooking the ocean. The caption reads &quot;I can see my house from here&quot; in a playful, sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is not actually seeing their house from the library, but rather is enjoying a relaxing and scenic view.</p>

<h2>first-seen</h2>
<p><i>Because Git doesn't preserve file modification times, this metadata file contains the file's modification time when it was added to the library.</i></p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
