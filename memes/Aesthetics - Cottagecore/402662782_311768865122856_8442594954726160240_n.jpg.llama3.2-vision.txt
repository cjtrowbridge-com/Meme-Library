This meme is an image of a small, modern, and minimalist house with a single room and a large deck. The text "Tiny House, Big Ego" appears above the house, suggesting that the house's owner is trying to make up for its small size by being overly proud and self-important. The image is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, poking fun at the idea of someone trying to make a big deal out of a tiny house.
