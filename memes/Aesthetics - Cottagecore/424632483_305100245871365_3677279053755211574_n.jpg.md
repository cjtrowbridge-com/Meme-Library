<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a picture of a woman on a rooftop, surrounded by a large collection of potted plants. The text &quot;I can hear you but I don&#x27;t care&quot; is written above her, implying that she&#x27;s ignoring the people below her, who are likely complaining about the noise and mess of her plant collection. The humor comes from the contrast between her peaceful, self-sufficient lifestyle and the potential chaos she&#x27;s causing for her neighbors.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
