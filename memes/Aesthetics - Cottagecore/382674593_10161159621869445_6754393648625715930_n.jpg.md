<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a photo of a person covered in leaves and vines, with a serious expression. The image is captioned &quot;Dress for the job you want&quot; in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the idea that one should dress professionally for a job interview. The humor comes from the absurdity of dressing in a way that is literally &quot;for the job&quot; of being a tree or a plant.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">&quot;Dress for the job you want&quot; Yor , ~~ \¥Re AG &quot;&gt; 7 / ag NO 7 : 4 = b &gt; oe * ) - ion , Me ce ke f 4 ea - aap J 4 &quot; , p Ls os a se fe S| ag se Fee Cc) ND ee ae ~ eee is ea Sale / a: gens al SE Ae Mae re Wea os a) 7 Se ee OO Pane Ce my ee. oe “ foe EET NS Ra EA ei Page anc SON wi ae AN ae O58: a o 4 ~%. iff id oe m7 b!
