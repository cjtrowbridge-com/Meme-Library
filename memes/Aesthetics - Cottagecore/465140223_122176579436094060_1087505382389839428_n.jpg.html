<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a series of images showing the construction of a bunker in a backyard. The first image shows a hole in the ground, the second shows the construction of a bunker in the hole, and the third shows a completed bunker with a ladder leading up to it. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not digging it&quot; is written above the third image.</p>
