<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme features a woman in a garden, digging with a shovel, surrounded by lush greenery. The text &quot;Action is the antidote to despair&quot; is written in a clean, modern font, while the quote &quot;Action is the antidote to despair&quot; is attributed to &quot;Joan Baez&quot;.</p>
