This meme is a humorous commentary on the difference between the rich and the poor. The text on the left reads: "Everyone is like 'If I was rich, I'd buy...' and then gives a humorous, extravagant wish, such as 'I'd buy designer clothes and diamonds.' However, the meme then subverts this expectation by saying 'I'm over here like I'd buy a greenhouse.'" This is a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that someone who is not wealthy might not have the luxury to buy expensive things, but can still have a simple, practical, and affordable option like a greenhouse.
