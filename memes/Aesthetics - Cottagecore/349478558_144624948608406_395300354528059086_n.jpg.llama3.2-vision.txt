The meme is a humorous image of a library with a large, abandoned library with a massive, overgrown library with a large, overgrown library with a large, overgrown library. The text in the image reads: "I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right." The image is meant to be humorous and ironic, poking fun at the idea of a library being a place of learning and knowledge, but instead being a place of overgrowth and decay.
