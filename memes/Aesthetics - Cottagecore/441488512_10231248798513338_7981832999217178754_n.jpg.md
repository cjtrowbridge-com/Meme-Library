<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a couple walking together, with the woman eating a snack and the man carrying a cat in a strange, makeshift &quot;pouch&quot; made from his overalls. The image is captioned &quot;If this isn&#x27;t the future you want, I&#x27;m not interested.&quot; The joke is that the man is so committed to his relationship that he&#x27;s willing to carry a cat in his clothes, even if it&#x27;s not the most practical or comfortable solution.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">If this isn&#x27;t the future you want I&#x27;m not interested SRG wy, fi taee oe anne fe od 3 a mes | 2 ms ‘ j &#125; My 4: es I sae aes At KN aL , 0.3 Rig Le . » ’ &gt; 7 » ‘ N ‘ BS VY hy pre eee i \ A . i: * i D tae / , , ‘ S ‘ y yf ri. a ~ # QW oA sa’ . .
