<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous image with a caption that pokes fun at the idea of &quot;giving something a makeover&quot; or &quot;giving something a new look&quot; by using an old, familiar phrase in a new and unexpected way. The image shows a cartoon man sitting at a table in a garden, surrounded by animals, eating a meal, while a record player plays music in the background. The text above the image reads: &quot;stop glamorizing &#x27;the grind&#x27; and start glamorizing whatever this is&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
