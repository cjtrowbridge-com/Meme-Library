This meme is a photo of a person holding up a dirty, old, and broken Wii Sports Resort game disc, with a small amount of dirt and plants growing out of it. The text on the disc reads "Wii Sports Resort" and has a few scratches and marks on it. The meme is likely poking fun at the idea that even the most high-tech and advanced technology can eventually fall apart and become a part of the natural world.
