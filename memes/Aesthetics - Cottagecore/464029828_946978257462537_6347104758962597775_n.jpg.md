<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a wizard in a forest, looking at a clock that says &quot;hast&quot; (an old-fashioned word for &quot;has&quot;) and &quot;not&quot; (a negative word). The text above the image reads &quot;No, I will not be late&quot; and the text below it says &quot;No, I will not be on time&quot;. The image is humorous because it shows a wizard who is both late and on time, which is a contradictory and absurd situation.</p>
