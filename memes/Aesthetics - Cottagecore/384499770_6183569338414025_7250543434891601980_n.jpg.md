<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous response to a missed text. The text reads, &quot;hey sorry I missed your text, I am processing a non-stop 24/7 onslaught of information with a brain designed to eat berries in a cave.&quot; The joke is that the person is using a humorous and absurd explanation for why they missed the text, implying that their brain is so busy with information that it&#x27;s like having a brain designed to eat berries in a cave, which is a ridiculous and absurd explanation.</p>
