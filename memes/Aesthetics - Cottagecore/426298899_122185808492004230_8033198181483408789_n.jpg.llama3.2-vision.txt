This meme features a photo of a person wearing a ridiculous outfit, including a large hat and a sign that says "Trespassers will be composted". The image is humorous because it's a playful take on the traditional "Trespassers will be prosecuted" sign, with a humorous and absurd twist. The text "Trespassers will be composted" is a clever and witty way to poke fun at the idea of a serious warning sign.
