<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous comparison between two images of a small, white house. The top image is a plain, unadorned house, while the bottom image is a house transformed into a vibrant, musical-themed wonderland, with a piano-shaped entrance, a &quot;D&quot;J&quot; sign, and a &quot;R&quot;eady&quot; sign. The text &quot;A simple reminder. Life is what you make of it.&quot; is written below the bottom image, implying that the second house is a creative, optimistic response to the first one.</p>
