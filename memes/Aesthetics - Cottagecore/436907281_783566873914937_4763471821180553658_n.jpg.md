<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a young boy with his hand on his forehead, looking puzzled. The text above him reads &quot;DAMN... I kinda no longer wish to participate in society&quot;. The meme is likely used to express frustration or annoyance with the demands or expectations of society, and the boy&#x27;s facial expression is a comedic way to convey that feeling.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">DAMN..... | kinda 7 no longer wish to participate in - society . ed | ne Â° .</p>
