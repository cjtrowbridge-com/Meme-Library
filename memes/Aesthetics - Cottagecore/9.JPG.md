<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a city, but it&#x27;s actually a giant forest, with skyscrapers and buildings completely overgrown with vines and trees. The image is captioned &quot;When you finally get that 1st job, but you still live in the parent&#x27;s basement&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">CAL. urs) ae a i ee) I a TS a ee) Se ee 1 eer Be and eee Oe, SR ae pee SNe A nie) aT wl 4 esa ena Na WY \ hE tee id NP aes ST A See ng: hare ay aeenas ae ae ‘eS ea ae CR ere ne | a ea 1 Sie ar i ReN Cl EL. wu &#123; Z é Wes tse AN SF ets » ae) ete SF eles | as UE Pk day ee = A ae Fe Ree co Wy, Gece am LAS as a De Ce i Caer cae Bl 1 | ieee eae matte oo ROB ee hs A ae, ae ee Pe eect Oe | OEE N | es ‘nt: SN Ae Lee cal pene  ot tee pw TINS a: SU gece SA oer | ee ZS, KS as er N TA Oy BS ~ ee om ‘ ete ee oo eee BOR hn RS a igs SN SRN EAE, SE Ra IASB, ORS aS, WORE SRO WINER) © oad | PRS Pree eh att eS Ra his WR pee oa eS TNE rs NON, aaa ct ae eS sas NE NA) o&gt; ae IX dele aa Thr as Py AAC Rae \O Re PARE DRS SAARI NESS ER WT A £Gby EO NY ee I es NA BPA SN SE eo RY OIE ES, ROE YM ee cal ON i</p>
