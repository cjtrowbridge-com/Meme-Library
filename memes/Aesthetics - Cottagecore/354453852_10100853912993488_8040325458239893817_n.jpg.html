<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the idea of &quot;sustainable living&quot; in a hyper-ironic and satirical way. The first panel shows a person marveling at the plants on a building, with the text &quot;Wow, so progressive!&quot; The second panel shows a person looking at a small house in a garden, with the text &quot;Ew, flyover country.&quot; The meme is poking fun at the idea that &quot;sustainable living&quot; is often associated with high-end, modern, and luxurious buildings, while &quot;sustainable living&quot; in a small, rural, or &quot;flyover&quot; area is often seen as a less-appearing, less-pleasing, and less-pleasant place.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
