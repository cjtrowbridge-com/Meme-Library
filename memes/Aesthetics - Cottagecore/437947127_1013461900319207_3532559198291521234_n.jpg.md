<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is an image of a person standing in a field of crops, with a cityscape in the background. The text &quot;Food Independence is Revolutionary&quot; is written above the image. The image is likely a humorous commentary on the idea that having control over one&#x27;s own food is a revolutionary act, rather than a straightforward statement about food independence.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">FOOD INDEPENDENCE IS REVOULTIONARY</p>
