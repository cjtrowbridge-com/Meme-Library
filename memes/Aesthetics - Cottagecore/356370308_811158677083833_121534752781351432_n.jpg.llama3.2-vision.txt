This meme is a humorous commentary on the way of life of our ancestors. The text reads: "They called our way of life primitive, then created a way of life that destroys the earth in less than 200 years." The image is likely a simple, dark background with a small, circular icon of a person, possibly a cartoon or a real person's photo, but the text is the main focus.
