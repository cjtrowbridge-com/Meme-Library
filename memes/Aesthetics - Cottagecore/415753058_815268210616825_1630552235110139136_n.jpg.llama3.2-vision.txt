The meme is a humorous comparison of two images of a front yard. The first image, dated 2022, shows a typical suburban lawn with a few trees and some bushes. The second image, dated 2023, shows the same yard transformed into a lush, overgrown garden with a variety of plants and flowers. The text above the images reads, "Progress after one year converting a water-dependent lawn to 70 species of mostly native plants, Ontario."
