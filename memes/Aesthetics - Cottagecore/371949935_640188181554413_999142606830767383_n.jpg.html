<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous example of a &quot;how-to&quot; article from the satirical website &quot;wikiHow.&quot; The title is &quot;Affordable Ways to Practice Self-Care,&quot; and the first &quot;tip&quot; is &quot;Abandon Society. Why go to work when you can become friends with a raccoon?&quot; The image is likely a cartoon or illustration of a person standing in a forest, looking at a group of trees, with a raccoon in the distance.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
