<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a character from the animated TV series &quot;Simpson&#x27;s&quot; named &quot;Bart&quot; from the episode &quot;The Bart-It-All&quot; in 1993. The character is depicted with a sandwich and a drink, and the text &quot;You guys go ahead, I&#x27;m gonna dilly dally&quot; appears above it. The phrase is a play on words, using the phrase &quot;dilly dally&quot; which means to delay or put off something.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ho. oa q = f] You guys go ahead I&#x27;m | y: . 7 J NF a gonna dilly dally eae * yj - 5 .
