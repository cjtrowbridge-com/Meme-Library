The meme is a humorous illustration of a fictional, absurdly complex and fantastical water treatment system, labeled as "Earthships". The image depicts a house with various components, including a solar panel, a cistern, a water tank, and a grey water tank, all connected in a single, cramped space. The text at the top of the image reads "Earthships" and the text at the bottom reads "@_iarchitect".
