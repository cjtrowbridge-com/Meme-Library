<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous quote from a book, juxtaposed with a tweet from a famous person. The quote, from &quot;The Panda&#x27;s Thumb&quot; by Stephen Jay Gould, is a witty and satirical commentary on the relationship between intelligence and physical ability. The tweet from &quot;The Amazing&quot; (Ama) Udofa is a humorous observation on the importance of creativity and talent in the face of adversity.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>

There are also so many people who tried and burned out, or were forced to give up their passion to concentrate on making enough money to live. 6:43 AM - 12/23/22 , dawn-has-a Follow “Tam, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein&#x27;s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” - Stephen Jay Gould, The Panda&#x27;s Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History</p>
