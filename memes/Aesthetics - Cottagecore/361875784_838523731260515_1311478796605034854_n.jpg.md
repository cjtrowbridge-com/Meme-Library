<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image that juxtaposes a serene and peaceful scene of a pond with a famous painting by Claude Monet, &quot;The Water Lilies,&quot; with a quote that seems to be a misquote of the actual quote &quot;The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don&#x27;t know.&quot; The actual quote is not present in the image. The actual quote is a quote from the famous artist, and the image is a quote from the famous artist.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Bane Tai Bea TE” ‘i yi BOG D r, ey nT 4 Fon ‘ ar écsos Le ,) ee SELLS Seggac &gt; aaa!
