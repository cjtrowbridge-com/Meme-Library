There're so many talented people
with wonderful creative brains &
ideas that we will never hear from
because they are too busy surviving.
There are also so many people who
tried and burned out, or were forced
to give up their passion to
concentrate on making enough
money to live.

“Tam, somehow, less interested in the weight
and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in
the near certainty that people of equal talent
have lived and died in cotton fields and
sweatshops.”
- Stephen Jay Gould, The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in
Natural History
