<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a comic strip that illustrates the changing nature of work and technology over time. The first panel shows a conversation between a junior and a senior, with the junior asking &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot; The second panel shows the senior working in a traditional office, while the third panel shows the junior working in a modern, high-tech environment. The final panel shows a farmer working in a field, with the text &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot; appearing again, implying that the answer is &quot;as a farmer&quot;.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">| | | | a = ia SEE YOURSELF LX ree | | ae h a = ae IN 5 YEARS? 9 V0) VO] as —— vel we i (Vea er ; y, ——— 4 5 y IN ) | q 5 = am /) (\ ver | |) ao Vs &quot;= A 7 ee —S\__ AL | G [2 4 RK | = | —” A — eee 2] | 5 ar = ea) Z| = )) 2 | ————————— — &gt;&lt; C, yy — Sa ot, ae &lt;— SSS ———— -— \i Gee — q WHERE DO YOU a ~ \Vi 7 Saree 2 23 —— je, | SEE YOURSELF  &amp; i \Z ay = le, r Na | mn IN 5 YEARS? 7 See ie Af ee &amp; .  ™ | y Ti &amp; Pe OO See WY / Oy PN SK) ee Ae eee uc ‘= y) fe. ye PG Ser Gx Le —— G o* pe t 2 el (j= ji \) a ee Ae Bes &gt; wy | MW Cy oN ) “amg I rh Seen OY “GT Wy 1 S ~N eu (| Lee | a Sa pea) “i —&lt; &#125; PM ( | WC = 4 OE NN MN NEDA IOP SSE</p>
