<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous comparison between the before and after of a lawn. It shows a house with a lawn in the &quot;before&quot; picture, and a house with a garden in the &quot;after&quot; picture, with a caption that says &quot;Two years of progress converting a water dependent lawn to native plants using a lawn removal rebate from the water company, Southern California&quot;. The joke is that the house&#x27;s lawn has been replaced with a garden, implying that the owner has made a successful effort to reduce their water usage.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
