<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a picture of a futuristic, high-tech cityscape with towering buildings and advanced technology. The text &quot;I can see for miles and miles and miles&quot; is written in a playful, childlike font at the top of the image, referencing the classic song &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; by The Who. The image is a humorous take on the song&#x27;s lyrics, exaggerating the idea of being able to see for miles and miles and miles.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">= eat No ca : =e a 8 A. hg lM = 2 2 4 aH Qy 2 eee = t ae ae a Nay i = ’ t ‘ gaat TS the maeagt = ae fr , = ae ea Sar. aaa Ei et a ee Oo ee whee : eee pes ere R yg TJ) 7  — a (a A cy ; \y we ae ‘ea te a / — b ae rae oles a é a : a ci. ae 5 c Pe VL eae ee SE ee ae a = if : ae cr oe 4 : a“ See ae Se ~~ - -. @ ge gel ee han ia</p>
