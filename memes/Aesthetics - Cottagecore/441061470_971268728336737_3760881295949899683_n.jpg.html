<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous take on the idea that rural life in 1927 was very different from modern times. The image shows a woman in a rural setting, nursing a baby, while a goat is also nursing from her. The text above the image reads &quot;Rural homestead life in 1927 when the mothers aren&#x27;t able to breastfeed.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
