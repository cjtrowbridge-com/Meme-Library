This meme is a humorous response to a missed text. The text reads, "hey sorry I missed your text, I am processing a non-stop 24/7 onslaught of information with a brain designed to eat berries in a cave." The joke is that the person is using a humorous and absurd explanation for why they missed the text, implying that their brain is so busy with information that it's like having a brain designed to eat berries in a cave, which is a ridiculous and absurd explanation.
