<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous and darkly satirical image featuring a dilapidated and eerie-looking Victorian-style greenhouse with a broken and twisted iron staircase. The text overlaid on the image reads: &quot;collapse has its costs to those / tragically stuck inside / it&#x27;s a rotting corpse / but it doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t have both / knives and flowers / while inside / the belly of the beast.&quot; The image is meant to be a darkly humorous and ironic commentary on the human experience of pain and suffering.</p>
