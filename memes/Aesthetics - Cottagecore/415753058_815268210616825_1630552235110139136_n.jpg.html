<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous comparison of two images of a front yard. The first image, dated 2022, shows a typical suburban lawn with a few trees and some bushes. The second image, dated 2023, shows the same yard transformed into a lush, overgrown garden with a variety of plants and flowers. The text above the images reads, &quot;Progress after one year converting a water-dependent lawn to 70 species of mostly native plants, Ontario.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
