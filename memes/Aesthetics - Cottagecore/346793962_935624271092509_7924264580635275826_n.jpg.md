<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous comparison between two movie titles. The top image is a mining scene, with the text &quot;In Search of Gold&quot; above it. The bottom image is a scene of people walking through a green field, with the text &quot;We lost the diamond&quot; above it. The meme is poking fun at the idea that the second title is a more accurate description of what happened in the first movie.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Pe, i a ag Bart | RS on ha So We lost theDiamond = a St y. es as</p>
