This meme is a before-and-after comparison of a house. The "before" image is a photo of a house made entirely out of shipping containers, with empty spaces and no interior. The "after" image is a photo of a completed, modern home with a beautiful interior, with the text "I'm not lazy, I'm just reorganizing my space" appearing above it.
