This meme is a humorous commentary on the modern human experience. The text reads, "Damn can you imagine being a human during the paleolithic age just eating salmon and berries and storytelling around campfires and star gazing... no jobs, no traffic, no ads, no poverty, no capitalism, no trauma, just pure vibes." The meme pokes fun at the idea of how much simpler and more peaceful life was in the past, compared to the modern world's many stresses and complexities.
