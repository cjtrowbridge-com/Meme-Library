This meme is a play on the phrase "is this a joke?" It features a character from the anime "LuckyÂ Star" in a state of confusion, with a speech bubble saying "Is this freedom?" The text at the top reads "Men who literally owned enslaved human beings" and the text at the bottom reads "A piece of paper in 1776." The meme is a commentary on the irony that the US Declaration of Independence, which is often seen as a symbol of American freedom, was written by and for people who owned slaves. The character's confusion and question is a humorous way of pointing out the hypocrisy of the founding fathers.
