This meme is an image of a small, rustic wooden shed with solar panels on the roof. The panels are angled in a way that creates a humorous, exaggerated "face" with a "smile" made from the panels' reflective surfaces. The text "I can see you" is written in a playful, cursive font above the "smile", implying that the shed is "watching" or "judging" something.
