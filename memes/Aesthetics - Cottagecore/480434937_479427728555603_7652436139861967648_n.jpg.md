<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous illustration of a fictional, absurdly complex and fantastical water treatment system, labeled as &quot;Earthships&quot;. The image depicts a house with various components, including a solar panel, a cistern, a water tank, and a grey water tank, all connected in a single, cramped space. The text at the top of the image reads &quot;Earthships&quot; and the text at the bottom reads &quot;@_iarchitect&quot;.</p>
