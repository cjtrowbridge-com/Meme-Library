<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a photo of a white opossum wearing a cowboy hat, accompanied by a quote in a western-style font. The text reads: &quot;I SPIT I CUSS DAMN SURE RAISE A FUSS BUT MOST OF ALL I ADVOCATE FOR THE TOTAL EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASS.&quot; The image is humorous and ironic, as it juxtaposes a typical western-style quote with a reference to a working-class movement, while also featuring an opossum, an animal not typically associated with the western genre.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">i SPIT  1OUSS RAISE A FUSS \&quot; â€˜Gia.</p>
