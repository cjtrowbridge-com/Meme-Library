<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous comparison between two types of lawns: one made of artificial turf and one made of living plants. The text &quot;THIS KILLS LIFE&quot; appears above a photo of a lawn made of artificial turf, while &quot;THIS CREATES LIFE&quot; appears above a photo of a garden or garden-like setting. The meme is saying that while a lawn made of artificial turf is lifeless and life-destroying, a garden or garden-like setting is full of life and life-creating.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
