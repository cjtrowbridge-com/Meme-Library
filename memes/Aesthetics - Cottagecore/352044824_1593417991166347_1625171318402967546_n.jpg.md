<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a split-screen image of a brick wall with a broken arch. The left side shows a complete arch, while the right side shows a broken arch with a missing section. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not arguing, I&#x27;m just explaining why I&#x27;m right&quot; appears above the broken arch.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">CART EO  1 KER KOHL s\ eo ee Sy ine ea 2 il any â€˜is 2  oi) in =</p>
