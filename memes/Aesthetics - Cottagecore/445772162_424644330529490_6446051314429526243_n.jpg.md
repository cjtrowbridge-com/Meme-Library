<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image featuring a photo of a man with a puzzled expression, accompanied by a quote from the novel &quot;The Catcher in the Riddle&quot; by J.D. Salinger. The quote reads: &quot;The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live nobly for one.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">“The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.” — J. D. Salinger  eid</p>
