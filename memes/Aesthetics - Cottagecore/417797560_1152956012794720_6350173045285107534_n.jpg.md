<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a picture of a cozy living room with a fireplace, a comfortable couch, and a beautiful view of the outdoors. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not arguing, I&#x27;m just explaining why I&#x27;m right&quot; appears in a speech bubble above a character&#x27;s head, implying that the person is being stubborn and refusing to listen to others. The image is meant to be humorous and relatable, poking fun at the tendency to be stubborn and argumentative.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">y &gt; ‘. | ‘Diva.
