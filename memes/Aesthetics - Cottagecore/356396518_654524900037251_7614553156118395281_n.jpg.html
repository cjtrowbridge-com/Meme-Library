<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme features a parrot with a shocked expression, captioned &quot;you, trapped in the ideology of capitalism&quot; and &quot;the things that remind you another world is possible&quot;. The image is meant to be humorous and relatable, poking fun at the idea that even in a capitalist society, there are still people who are aware of and want to change the system. The parrot&#x27;s expression is meant to convey a sense of surprise and wonder at the idea of an alternative world, which is a common feeling for those who are aware of the problems of capitalism and want to change it.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
