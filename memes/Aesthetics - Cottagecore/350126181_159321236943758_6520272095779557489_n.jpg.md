<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a small, simple hut with a tree growing out of it, with a child sitting under the tree&#x27;s branches. The text at the top reads &quot;Perfect example of...&quot; and the text at the bottom reads &quot;Respect Nature &amp; Nature will give you back&quot;. The image is meant to be a playful and ironic commentary on the idea that if you treat nature with respect, it will reward you with something wonderful.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Perfect example of.. ie — mt o&gt; ‘ Respect Nature &amp; Nature will give you back &amp;:</p>
