<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a person building a small cabin using a single sheet of paper, titled &quot;The Squatter&quot;. The text reads: &quot;Built in one day by two men. Heats quickly. No under-draughts. Sheet iron stove may be substituted for fireplace. With heavy snow it will keep warm in sub-zero weather. Use 2 x 4 timbers throughout. Use this cabin before you build your prize cabin.&quot; The image is likely meant to be humorous and satirical, poking fun at the idea of building a simple, simple cabin.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">es pO 2k Zi YS She JR yay &gt; . m f- ts Lae (i sh — hi A So LARA “TH Be AOR THIN ewes?” 4 [| KI) \ BY TwO MEN.
