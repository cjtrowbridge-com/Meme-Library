This meme is a humorous take on the idea of a romantic relationship. The text reads "horny but for someone to build a homestead with me & live consciously in alignment with the seasons" and is presented in a playful, handwritten font. The image is not actually needed to understand the joke, as the text is the main point of the meme.
