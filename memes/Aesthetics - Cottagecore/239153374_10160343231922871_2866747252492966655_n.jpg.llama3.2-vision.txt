The meme is a picture of a long, narrow hallway with many windows on one side and a wall of doors on the other. The text "I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right" is written on a sign on the wall. The image is meant to be humorous because it's a literal representation of someone being stubborn and refusing to listen to others.
