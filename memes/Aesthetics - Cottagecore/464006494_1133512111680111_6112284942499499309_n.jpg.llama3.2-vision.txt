This meme is a humorous take on the idea that cooking is a messy and chaotic process. The image shows a messy kitchen with a pot on the stovetop and a quote overlayed on top of it. The quote reads: "Cooking is like a relationship, it's messy, it's complicated, and it's always a little bit of a disaster, but in the end, it's worth it."
