This meme is a play on the phrase "the goal is to get the bag," a popular saying that means achieving success or wealth. The image shows a large house and garden, with the caption "the goal is to get the bag" above it, and the response "but the goal is to get the land" below it. The meme is poking fun at the idea that people often focus on material wealth, but the real goal is to have a stable and secure life, like owning a house and land, rather than just wealth.
