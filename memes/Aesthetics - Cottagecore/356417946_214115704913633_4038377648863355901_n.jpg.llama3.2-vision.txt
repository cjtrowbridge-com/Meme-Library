The meme is a humorous take on the idea that someone who has never tried forest bathing (a form of therapy that involves spending time in nature to reduce stress) is being asked to do so. The text at the top of the image reads: "Therapist: 'Have you ever tried forest bathing? You should get out to the woods more. Trees produce ions that relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and some even find spirituality in it.'" The image below is a dark, eerie forest scene with a figure in the distance, and the text at the bottom reads: "Me and my friends six months later: THE HUMAN WORLD HAS FAILED."
