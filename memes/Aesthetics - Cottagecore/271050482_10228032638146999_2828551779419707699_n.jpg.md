<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a darkly humorous image of a person being devoured by a forest of trees and animals, with a full moon in the background. The text &quot;Feed your oppressors to the land&quot; is written in a bold, gothic font at the bottom of the image. The overall tone is one of dark, satirical humor, implying that one&#x27;s enemies should be made to suffer in a way that is both literal and metaphorical.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Sea FABRA ARV NES.
