<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a simple image of a house with a caption that reads &quot;I can hear you.&quot; The image is likely a play on the idea of a house having a &quot;listening&quot; or &quot;listening&quot; feature, but the actual meaning is a play on the phrase &quot;I can hear you&quot; being a phrase that is often used in a different context.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Aig _ we) s ee /, 5 SEE EL En 02, LGD, a LO Ze , Ly ie FE: oa : the AEE LE eee JE b ty Me A ey aoe LF 7 al Li FE ca Z | q | | | | 7 yl s | | = — lie. ee SCP KZ —&lt; A iy 9 i as re Te a =f sy a a ee ae hd ‘le: ra = = , - ba ee (Sen We = © oe y = = i ge ak = a =| — | Fate ann es a ied «ali —— | | | aig Le ste , ce 7 ea i hidu dial ie tah Cg Pek ae ae ee ee vidi hb ai is por nasonelh me eso, ee if - ) We | tele cay Ws! one get mi: Sirsa ae ash Rf \ home eS Hib ig RS sae eee ee</p>
