The meme is a split-screen image showing two different environments. On the left, a cozy cabin with a fireplace and a comfortable chair, with a sign that reads "Welcome to the Cabin". On the right, a cramped and dirty shipping container with a sign that reads "Welcome to the Shipping Container". The text at the top of the image reads "When you're trying to be cozy but your roommate is a shipping container".
