This meme is an image of a small, rustic house built on top of a garden, with a large garden below it. The garden is filled with a variety of vegetables and plants, and the house has a small, wooden bridge leading to it. The text "I'm not lazy, I'm just on garden time" appears in the image, implying that the person is taking a break to focus on their garden rather than doing something else.
