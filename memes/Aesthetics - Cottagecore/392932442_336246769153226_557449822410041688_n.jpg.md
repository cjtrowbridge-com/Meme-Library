<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a picture of a small, rustic cabin in the woods. The text on the image reads &quot;I&#x27;m not arguing, I&#x27;m just explaining why I&#x27;m right.&quot; This is a humorous way of saying that someone is being stubborn or uncooperative, and is using their &quot;right&quot; to be argumentative as an excuse.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">SN Secaieger Cnt ARS in NRO Mag MG i Ta) arco POS ete ed ON ah REE CORR EH VE, Siok COR ee ee ag aah ee a ene ee Cae a ae OR eam ahh i) ae a a eS ea Cw ee Ae a SS ling | ener ae: rai B/S | eee ||] H | (TTT ae a a 79 SSM &#125; TL ge eee Mey | e\ ana, SS One aaa ae &lt;o] a NESSES. 7: ~ — =e y ; i Wiis SS res = SS SS eer eS ea) aes ie Besa cal em i a =) ig Do caer eS Oe pe MM Rogen | ee | eet | a = [—= =) ie 2] ae ee | a os as Reema | Brant | 7 =) et eure 2 DRA AIS Sam ewe re were cee Vat Ps SEN Pe niger ae ESR! see i) : See Soe ger iatean Le) eee eet ee iad eneerleinoiden er he tee ee eee ee PSE AACE ae RE RS Se a a ee gk see he memes oo ue ee a Se oo Beg EN SAPS LoS Ce ae a ee Ee haa ta bias SSE Se ANE eA.
