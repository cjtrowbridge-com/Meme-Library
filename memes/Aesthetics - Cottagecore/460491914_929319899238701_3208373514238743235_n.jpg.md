<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a visual comparison between &quot;Industrial Agriculture&quot; and &quot;Regenerative Agriculture&quot;. The left side of the image shows a large, industrialized farm with a tractor and rows of crops, while the right side depicts a lush, diverse landscape with a variety of plants and animals. The text &quot;Industrial Agriculture&quot; and &quot;Regenerative Agriculture&quot; are written above each side, highlighting the contrast between these two approaches to farming.</p>
