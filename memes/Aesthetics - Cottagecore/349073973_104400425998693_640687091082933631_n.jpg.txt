To the folks who just showed up in the 43ft
$200,000 fifth wheel, that costs double my house.
you have a beautiful rig.

To the folks who are down in the woods in a bivvy
tent, you guys are hard core, awesome setup
down there.

To the folks who just pulled in with their 1979 c
class with more rust than panel. | can only imagine
the memories you've made in that thing. | bet that
dent has a story.

To the folks that took that last site that nobody
wanted you pulled in, put down the seats in their
mini van, and started cooking. Your dinner smells
delightful.

Yâ€˜all, we all camp differently, and we may not
agree on it all, but we have to remember the only
thing that matters is memories are being made,
and you're getting 120% out of your time with
your loved ones. You have to forget HOW you go
camping, and remember WHY you go camping.
THAT is camping my friends. Spread love at the
campground this season.
