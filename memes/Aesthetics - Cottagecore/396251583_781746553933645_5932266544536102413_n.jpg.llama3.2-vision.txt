This meme features a cartoon of a person in a kitchen, surrounded by potted plants. The person is holding a potted plant and says "I'll just put them here until the danger of frost passes - probably next April." The image is a humorous commentary on the common practice of moving plants indoors to protect them from cold temperatures, but the person's comment is ironic and humorous because it implies that they will be leaving the plants in the same place for an extremely long period of time.
