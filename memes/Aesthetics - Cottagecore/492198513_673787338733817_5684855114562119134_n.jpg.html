<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous image of a garden gate with a sign that says &quot;no i don&#x27;t have snap&quot; and &quot;contact me through a series of intricate rituals&quot;. The image is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that the person is not interested in engaging with someone through a complex and mysterious process.</p>
