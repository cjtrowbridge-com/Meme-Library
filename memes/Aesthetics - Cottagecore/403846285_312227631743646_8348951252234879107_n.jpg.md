<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a split-screen image with a top image of a small, cozy-looking house and a bottom image of a large, luxurious-looking house. The text &quot;I&#x27;ll be living in the top one&quot; is written above the top image, implying that the speaker will be living in a small, simple house, while the others will be living in a large, luxurious one.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ez eae ot. 2 ee a ne a at _- ; \ ne f a an +. VSS) 6 â€”</p>
