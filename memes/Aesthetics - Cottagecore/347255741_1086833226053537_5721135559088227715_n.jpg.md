<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a small, cozy cabin in the woods, with a desk and chair in the center. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not lazy, I&#x27;m just on energy-saving mode&quot; is written on a sign above the desk. The image is meant to poke fun at the idea of being &quot;lazy&quot; by presenting it as a legitimate, environmentally-friendly option.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Me een ee se a See  A Sie: REO  SB ee gle Po Seo) hn eee  ee Ee.
