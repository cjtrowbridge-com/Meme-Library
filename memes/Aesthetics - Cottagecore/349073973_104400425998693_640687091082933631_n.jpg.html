<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous story about a person&#x27;s experience at a campsite, where they are initially excited to have a $200,000 fifth wheel that costs twice as much as their house. The story is told in a humorous, conversational tone, with a mix of personal anecdotes and jokes. The text includes various references to camping and the author&#x27;s experience at the campsite.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">To the folks who just showed up in the 43ft $200,000 fifth wheel, that costs double my house. you have a beautiful rig.  To the folks who are down in the woods in a bivvy tent, you guys are hard core, awesome setup down there.  To the folks who just pulled in with their 1979 c class with more rust than panel. | can only imagine the memories you&#x27;ve made in that thing. | bet that dent has a story.  To the folks that took that last site that nobody wanted you pulled in, put down the seats in their mini van, and started cooking. Your dinner smells delightful.  Yâ€˜all, we all camp differently, and we may not agree on it all, but we have to remember the only thing that matters is memories are being made, and you&#x27;re getting 120% out of your time with your loved ones. You have to forget HOW you go camping, and remember WHY you go camping. THAT is camping my friends. Spread love at the campground this season.</p>
