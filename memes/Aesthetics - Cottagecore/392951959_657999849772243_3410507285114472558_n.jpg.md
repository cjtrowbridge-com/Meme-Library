<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the idea that people&#x27;s self-perceptions are often at odds with their actual reality. The image shows a hand reaching up from the depths of a pool of water, surrounded by flowers, with the phrase &quot;I dream of who I am&quot; written above it. The text below it says &quot;outside of capitalism,&quot; suggesting that the person&#x27;s aspirations are not being fulfilled by the societal norms of capitalism.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
