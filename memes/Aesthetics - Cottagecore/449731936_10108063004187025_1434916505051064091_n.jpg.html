<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a simple, humorous image. It shows a wind chime hanging from a porch or balcony, with a plant or vine growing up the support. The text &quot;S&quot; appears vertically on the left side of the image, followed by a series of &quot;S&quot;s, then &quot;S&quot; again, and finally &quot;S&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;U&quot;, &quot;P&quot;.</p>
