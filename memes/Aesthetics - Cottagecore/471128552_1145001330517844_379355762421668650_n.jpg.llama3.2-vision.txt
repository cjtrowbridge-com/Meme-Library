This meme is a picture of a person looking at a small, old-fashioned house in the middle of a forest. The text "DO YOU EVER JUST" is written in bold, pink letters across the top of the image. Below the text, a question mark is shown, implying that the person is asking if anyone ever just... something, but the rest of the sentence is cut off.
