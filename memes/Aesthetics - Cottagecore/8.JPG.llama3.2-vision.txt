The meme is a humorous image of a tree made of a computer motherboard, with a green and leafy top. The image is captioned "I told my wife I was going to reboot, she didn't understand." The joke is a play on words, using the computer term "reboot" to mean both restarting a computer and also having a romantic relationship.
