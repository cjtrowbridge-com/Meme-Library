<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous quote from the TV show &quot;The Office&quot; that is often used to express a lack of understanding or empathy towards someone&#x27;s feelings or situation. The text reads: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to explain to you that you should care about other people.&quot; The image is likely a simple, text-based graphic with this quote, possibly with a simple background or no image at all.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
