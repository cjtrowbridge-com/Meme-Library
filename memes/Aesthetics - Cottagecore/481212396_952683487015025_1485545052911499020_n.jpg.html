<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a humorous illustration of a person digging a tunnel to a secret underground bunker, but instead of a cozy living space, they&#x27;ve built a tiny garden and a kitchen, complete with a tiny table and a sign that reads &quot;Welcome to my underground kitchen&quot;. The image is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the idea of building a &quot;self-sufficient&quot; underground bunker, but instead of being a practical survival space, it&#x27;s a cozy and absurdly tiny kitchen.</p>
