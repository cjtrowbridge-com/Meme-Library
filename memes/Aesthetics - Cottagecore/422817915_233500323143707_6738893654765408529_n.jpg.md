<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a photo of a small, unfinished wooden house, often referred to as a &quot;tiny house&quot; or &quot;micro cabin.&quot; The image is captioned &quot;When you finally get to build your own tiny house, but you still can&#x27;t get away from your parents&#x27; basement.&quot;</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">tk &gt; me ene pine Fees erp aE # I .
