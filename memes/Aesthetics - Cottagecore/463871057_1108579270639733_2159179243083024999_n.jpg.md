<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a wizard-like character from the Harry Potter series, but instead of a wand, he&#x27;s holding a gun. The text &quot;I cast&quot; is at the top, and the bottom reads &quot;Non-Magic Missile&quot;. The image is a humorous take on the idea that even a wizard can&#x27;t always control his magic, and in this case, he&#x27;s using a non-magical, or non-mystical, missile to get the job done.</p>
