The meme is a playful invitation to a gathering of frogs, where they're having a party around a campfire under the moon. The image features a cartoon moon with a smiling face, surrounded by frogs in various costumes, playing instruments, and dancing. The text at the top of the image reads, "Unless you're doing whatever is going on here, please don't invite me anywhere."
