<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a person sitting inside a bear&#x27;s body, with the bear&#x27;s head and body made of a giant, furry, and fluffy bear costume. The text &quot;I can smell the desperation&quot; is overlaid on the image, suggesting that the person inside the bear is trying to escape or is in a difficult situation. The image is a playful and absurd take on the idea of being trapped or overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Po a ae ag i yy  Ty</p>
