<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous image of a small, rustic garden with a few rows of vegetables and a small wooden shed in the background. The text &quot;Don&#x27;t call it a dream, call it a plan&quot; appears in a large, white font at the top of the image. The image is meant to be ironic, implying that the garden is not just a dream, but a well-planned and successful project.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">AB oh “See eee. oT) ERR OSA Be Pig ae ne went ai ys Oy es ‘\eSaxs i oe Ro Sr ty ei SRSA fee eR 8 aes Ze ee ee ce pea Speen | fe i eo panies, 7 as Cl i I Aco ite 2 Rl a BB Yel ys fer) Shae kebe ct 0 eee eee 508 Ce Se ais eas ae gee ie Z 2» 4 o. es a fics Soe e esc te aoe ea se aa gee ae ee ae a ee eS: eee SGN peem crore a go BS EA baie Me = — Ss ae “ nee Proesishien Maen aan ps yee fi — i 7 a Aa WOES Ga Tee wy eee i We eee fray FF Roe —e cern ER Ps Ri eT Fret NOY yoni ee ra LP Wf asa mee tas! a Nore Soe ATU TT LT Eee ne ees ee cas eo REDO OE Ee Te Aa ee et gO pr te ee Games a re a ae ed SE ere a sh eae mie DON ee a ee oe i REY RR ye ace ROSE AOI &gt; FO ee i aie RAE SNe as hn” Made cine d BEN tI Oe NO ae S Nae | PARES IN be Fe cee na IN aaa NE i ai yu ce ea Rp pa OE OU as pert ee: it NT ewe ah A igh Nee it ZS OR ite be Nae i ce eens” Stee sy Tea</p>
