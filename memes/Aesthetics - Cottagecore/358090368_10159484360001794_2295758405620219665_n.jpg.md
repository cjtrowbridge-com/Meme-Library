<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the concept of &quot;personal gain&quot; versus &quot;community effort.&quot; The image features two panels of the character Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation, but with his face replaced with a &quot;meme face&quot; expression. The first panel shows him looking confused, while the second panel shows him looking triumphant. The text in the first panel reads &quot;Glorifying Individual Achievement &amp; Personal Gain,&quot; while the second panel reads &quot;Celebrating Community &amp; Collective Effort.&quot; The meme is poking fun at the idea that people often prioritize individual success over collective success, and the image is meant to be humorous and relatable.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">: GLORIFYING = INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT m8 GAIN aT UIT eS af deg EFFORT</p>
