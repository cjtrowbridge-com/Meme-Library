This meme is a humorous take on the concept of a "little garden" in a desolate or abandoned environment. The image shows a cracked and worn-out road with a "little garden" marked in the middle, with the text "my little garden" written above it. The text below it reads "collapsing biospheres" and "habitat loss", implying that even the most optimistic and small-scale efforts (like a "little garden") are not enough to save the environment from the effects of "collapsing biospheres" and "habitat loss".
