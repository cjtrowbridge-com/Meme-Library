<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image of a tree made of a computer motherboard, with a green and leafy top. The image is captioned &quot;I told my wife I was going to reboot, she didn&#x27;t understand.&quot; The joke is a play on words, using the computer term &quot;reboot&quot; to mean both restarting a computer and also having a romantic relationship.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">if aS mi re &quot; iB Bat 7 Reece “3 en i e Pa as ee . ie Fos gach AR : aa F - See AS is &gt;» aaa pe . wy, The pe Soh. ee ee ee 7 eo es PAL ee Boe! ae) |) + ee ty BS) ; ese (| | Cee. . ees H ee cs | Sen YI eon) , fates | aie | ib i bi llh TT &#123;f eae &#123; a i suai in Sl lll Set ara eigen ee ; BMS alia eteebes ts ch 4 Sct be cane Oe te eee So a a</p>
