<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a visual representation of the relationship between ego and nature. The image shows a person (Ego) at the center, surrounded by various animals and objects, which are connected to the person. The text &quot;Ego&quot; is above the person, and &quot;Nature&quot; is above a separate circle of animals and objects, which are connected to it. The idea is that the person&#x27;s ego is separate from and connected to the natural world, but also connected to it through various animals and objects.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">| 7 | | Ego Nature an er  y* » om € * € w ® Rf « 2» 4 a x we x | , ¥ * , ‘  * ‘ Ky yn a ee</p>
