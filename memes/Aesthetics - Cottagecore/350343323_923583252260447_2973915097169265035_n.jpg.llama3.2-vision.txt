The meme is a visual joke that contrasts two types of gardens: a wild, untamed "Eco System" (with a house in the background) and a well-manicured, luxurious "Ego System" (with a grand house and pool). The text at the top reads "Eco System" and at the bottom reads "Ego System". The humor comes from the idea that the two types of gardens are so different in style and quality, with the "Ego System" being a symbol of wealth and excess.
