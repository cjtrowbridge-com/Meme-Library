<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>The meme is a split image of a shipping container being converted into a house. The top image shows a large, empty shipping container, while the bottom image shows a cozy, fully-furnished house made from the same container. The text &quot;I&#x27;m not arguing, I&#x27;m just explaining why I&#x27;m right&quot; appears in the top image, implying that someone is being stubborn and refusing to listen to others.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p><i>Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.</i></p>
