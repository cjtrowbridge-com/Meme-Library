This meme is a humorous take on the current state of the internet. It features a photo of a therapist's office, with the therapist and patient sitting on a couch, but with a twist: the patient is not sitting on the couch, but is instead lying on a couch-like bed that is actually a giant mushroom. The text above the image reads: "And is this the global mycelial network in the room with us right now?" The joke is that the therapist is asking a question that is both literal and metaphorical, referencing the idea that the internet is a global network of interconnected computers that can be thought of as a "mushroom" that is spreading and growing in the "room" of the internet.
