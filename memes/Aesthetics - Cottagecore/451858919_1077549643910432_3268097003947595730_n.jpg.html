<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a humorous commentary on the importance of having a strong social network. The image features a screenshot of a tweet from a user named &quot;Jaclyn&quot; that reads, &quot;You all have to understand that having a network of friends is going to be crucial to your survival in the coming years.&quot; The text is presented in a plain, white font on a black background, and is surrounded by a photo of a forest floor, complete with leaves and mushrooms.</p>
