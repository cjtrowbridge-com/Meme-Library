<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme features a dark, cozy room with a bed, bookshelves, and a large window. The text &quot;I don&#x27;t need a therapist, I just need a library and a window&quot; appears in the image, implying that the speaker finds comfort and solace in the quiet, peaceful environment. The image is meant to be humorous and relatable, suggesting that some people can find emotional support in a simple, quiet environment.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">\l a x Nat AAAS ean BO ye ees eee : ih ay â„¢. : fi &quot;oO @</p>
