<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous comparison between two contrasting images. The top image depicts a medieval-style scene with a monk, a castle, and a crowd of people, with the text &quot;THE OLD WORLD IS ENDING...&quot; above it. The bottom image shows a post-apocalyptic scene with a group of people living in a new, sustainable environment, with the text &quot;A NEW EARTH IS FORMING...&quot; above it. The meme is meant to be humorous and satirical, suggesting that the old world is ending and a new, better world is being formed.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">THE OLD WORLD IS ENDING.. = a S g | [ | Ck Me ee | A ON PR. itl x: Nae ORAM si | \ ee a peg ae gai PR ewe: JAAS Oe eee eal A NEW EARTH IS FORMING... ) we oe ee 24 = ON oe tS Fe soe Ne fF Ba) TS pete fo yh, ease: WEL.
