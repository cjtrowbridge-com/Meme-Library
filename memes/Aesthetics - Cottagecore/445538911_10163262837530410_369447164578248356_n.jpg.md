<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a play on the phrase &quot;Computer, why do you sound like my mother?&quot; It&#x27;s a humorous reference to a scene from the movie &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; where a character asks a computer to sound like his mother. The meme uses this phrase as a humorous way to poke fun at the idea that computers can sometimes have a &quot;motherly&quot; tone.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">7 “Computer wT  ¥ |  Se SAVIN ZC Con cele] &quot; sound like my mother?”</p>
