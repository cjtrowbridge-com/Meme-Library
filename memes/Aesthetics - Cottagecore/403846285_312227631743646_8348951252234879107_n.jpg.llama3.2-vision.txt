The meme is a split-screen image with a top image of a small, cozy-looking house and a bottom image of a large, luxurious-looking house. The text "I'll be living in the top one" is written above the top image, implying that the speaker will be living in a small, simple house, while the others will be living in a large, luxurious one.
