The meme is a split image of a shipping container being converted into a house. The top image shows a large, empty shipping container, while the bottom image shows a cozy, fully-furnished house made from the same container. The text "I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right" appears in the top image, implying that someone is being stubborn and refusing to listen to others.
