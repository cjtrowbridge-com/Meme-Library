The meme is a humorous and darkly ironic image with the text: "Change is hard. But, staying somewhere you don't belong will literally destroy you." The image is likely a dark or eerie landscape, such as a forest or abandoned building, with the text appearing in a bold, neon-like font. The overall tone is meant to be humorous and satirical, poking fun at the idea that people often struggle with change, but also that staying in a situation that's not right for you can be disastrous.
