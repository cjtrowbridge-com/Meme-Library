<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a picture of the &quot;A-Frame&quot; cabin, a small, triangular-shaped house. The image is captioned &quot;I love my tiny home, I can fit my entire family in the loft&quot;. The meme is likely used to poke fun at the idea of a small, cozy home being able to fit a large family, implying that the family is actually quite small.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">Ca eal oe Ue | r TT |W\KWJg MWSMI J YY yyy) i Hi e/a Loe Si ,fuif ff fThWlYl lI&#125; ee UU = ry ]/ yj | 5 = % aa) 9 Hee ae an MM = f Fe LY A eee : iii) fe bl 5 LHe * “a te // EE 4 ia —— 2.
