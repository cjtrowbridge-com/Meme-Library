This meme is an image of a computer and chair in a dense, overgrown forest. The computer is on a small table, surrounded by weeds and vines, and the chair is partially buried in the dirt. The text at the top of the image reads: "I hope this email finds you well... never finds you. I hope you find yourself instead. I hope you are free." The image is a humorous commentary on the idea of being "unplugged" and finding freedom from the pressures of modern life.
