<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a humorous take on the concept of individualism and the idea that it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The text on the left says, &quot;They sell us individualist philosophy,&quot; and the text on the right says, &quot;Because we can&#x27;t defeat them alone.&quot; The image is likely a still from a popular anime or cartoon, showing a character looking out of a window or a window-like structure, with a determined or sad expression. The character is likely a protagonist or hero, and the image is meant to convey the idea that even when we are alone, we can still be a threat to others.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">ee en TMC [TLE r f philosophy © | 1 BP | | Because we can’t i. a Peete eld)</p>
