<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">This meme is a visual joke that uses a picture of a tree that has fallen over, but still has a few branches and leaves that are still alive. The text that appears in the image says &quot;When you fall, but you don&#x27;t give up&quot; and is written in a way that the word &quot;fall&quot; is in a different color than the rest of the text, and the word &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; is in a different color than the rest of the text. The meme is making a humorous point about perseverance and resilience.</p>

<h2>tesseract</h2>
<p title="Tesseract is often terrible and just gives a lot of nonsense characters, but it used to be the state of the art, and usually it is better at correctly representing text than llama-3.2-vision-11b.">a Ps aS : * om oe 8 2 : a : Sg, 5 i ie, ; 2 e s Pam ais ar : ; rode a x Renee Bees eS ak Pi ao xe at $$$ Dal When you fall, but you don&#x27;t</p>
