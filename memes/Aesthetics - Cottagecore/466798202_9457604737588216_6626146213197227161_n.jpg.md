<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p title="Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.">The meme is a humorous image that pokes fun at the idea that the police are the most trusted and important part of a community. The text on the sign reads: &quot;The safest communities don&#x27;t have the most cops, they have the most resources.&quot; The image is likely a satirical commentary on the common misconception that more police officers are needed to keep a community safe, when in reality, investing in resources such as education, healthcare, and economic development can actually create a safer and more stable community.</p>
