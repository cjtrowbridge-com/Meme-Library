This meme is a humorous and satirical take on the idea of dating in the modern era. The image shows an old man (Grandpa) watching a young woman (the "me" in the meme) working in a field, with a caption that reads "You won't get anything done, you're just going to get in the way." The text on the image reads "Me, every time I'm trying to work on a project" and "You won't get anything done, you're just going to get in the way."
