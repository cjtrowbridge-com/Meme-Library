<h2>llama-3.2-vision</h2>
<p><i>Llama-3.2-Vision-11B is a really good model that probably gets the visual details right but doesn't understand literary or media references, and often fails to accurately represent the physical arrangement of objects and the implied relationships between the objects.</i></p>
<p>This meme is a step-by-step guide to creating a simple paper fortune teller, also known as a &quot;cootie&quot; or &quot;daisy&quot; in some regions. The instructions are presented in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek manner, using a series of sarcastic and playful comments to guide the reader through the process. The text at the bottom of the image reads: &quot;Be sure to keep a 5mm / one-fifth of an inch margin (shown in gray) around the whole piece of paper to ensure all contents of the zine will photo copy properly.&quot;</p>
