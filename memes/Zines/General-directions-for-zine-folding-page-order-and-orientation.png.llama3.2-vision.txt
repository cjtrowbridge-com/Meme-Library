This meme is a step-by-step guide to creating a simple paper fortune teller, also known as a "cootie" or "daisy" in some regions. The instructions are presented in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek manner, using a series of sarcastic and playful comments to guide the reader through the process. The text at the bottom of the image reads: "Be sure to keep a 5mm / one-fifth of an inch margin (shown in gray) around the whole piece of paper to ensure all contents of the zine will photo copy properly."
